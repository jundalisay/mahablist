The name "麻逸" (Má Yì) could be interpreted in a few ways if used as a name for a person or a place:

As a Personal Name:

The character "麻" (má) might suggest qualities like resilience or natural elements, as hemp is a strong and versatile plant.

The character "逸" (yì) conveys ideas of freedom, leisure, or elegance.

Together, "麻逸" could imply a person who embodies both strength and a carefree spirit, making it a unique and meaningful name.

As a Place Name:

If "麻逸" were used to name a country or region, it might evoke imagery of a land that is both rich in natural resources (like hemp) and known for a relaxed or harmonious lifestyle.

This combination could suggest a culturally rich area that values both tradition and a laid-back way of living.

Overall, "麻逸" can carry positive connotations, suggesting a blend of strength, resilience, and a carefree nature, whether for a person or a place.



We're advocating for a return to Maharlika (not just a name change) that includes bringing back the positive aspects of the nation that Maharlika was known for.

An example is a trustworthy barter trade system which was known among foreign merchants.

We equate Ma-i to May-nila wherein Nila means blue blood or Maharlika (i.e. Ma-i is a place that has Maharlikas)

To make this advocacy different from others, we named it Maharlikanism, which is based mostly on Socrates such as having 4 classes of gold, silver, brass, iron which matches Ginoo, Babaylan, Maharlika, and Alipin.
