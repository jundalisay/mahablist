{{< n n="This simplifies Pigafetta's account of 1521 by subsituting pronouns with actual names to prevent confusion" >}}


We left Spain on Monday morning 1519 with 237 men.

<!-- ### Marianas

On Wednesday, March 6, 1521, we discovered a small island to the northwest, and two others toward the southwest, one of which was higher and larger than the other two.

Magellan wanted to get some fresh food at the large island. But its natives entered the ships and stole whatever they could get. They very deftly stole from us the small boat that was fastened to the poop of the flagship.

In wrath, Magellan went ashore with 40 armed men. They burned 50 houses and many boats, and killed 7 men. He recovered the small boat, and we departed immediately. Before we landed, some of our sick men begged us if we should kill any man or woman to bring the entrails to them, as they would recover immediately.

Each one of those people lives according to his own will, for they have no seignior. 
- They go naked.
- Some are bearded and have black hair that reaches to the waist. T
- They wear small palmleaf hats, as do the Albanians.
- They are as tall as we, and well-built.
- They have no worship.
- They are tawny, but are born white.
- Their teeth are red and black, for they think that is most beautiful.
- The women go naked except that they wear a narrow strip of bark as thin as paper, which grows between the tree and the bark of the palm, before their privies.
- They are good looking and delicately formed, and lighter complexioned than the men.
- Their women have black hair they wear loose and hanging down to the ground.
  - The women stay in the house, weaving mats, baskets, and other things needed in their houses, from palm leaves.
- They eat cocoanuts, camotes [batate], birds, figs one palmo in length [i.e., bananas], sugarcane, and flying fish, besides other things.
- They anoint the body and the hair with cocoanut and beneseed oil.
- Their houses are all built of wood covered with planks and thatched with leaves of the banana-tree two brazas long.
  - They have floors and windows.
  - The rooms and the beds are all furnished with the most beautiful palmleaf mats. 
  - They sleep on palm straw which is very soft and fine.
- Their only weapons are a kind of a spear pointed with a fishbone at the end.
- Those people are poor, but ingenious and very thievish. That's why we called those three islands as the islands of Ladroni [of thieves].
- Their amusement is to plough the seas in small boats.
  - Those boats resemble fucelere,193 but are narrower, and some are black, [some] white, and others red.
  - At the side opposite the sail, they have a large piece of wood pointed at the top, with poles laid across it and resting on the water, in order that the boats may sail more safely.
  - The sail is made from palmleaves sewn together and is shaped like a lateen sail. For rudders they use a certain blade resembling a hearth shovel which have a piece of wood at the end.
  - They can change stern and bow at will [literally: they make the stern, bow, and the bow, stern],194 and those boats resemble the dolphins which leap in the water from wave to wave.
- Those natives thought, according to the signs which they made, that there were no other people in the world but themselves.

## Samar (under Sulu?)

At dawn on Saturday, March 16 1521, we came upon Samar island 300 leagues from Ladroni [The Marianas].
- The next day, Magellan had two tents set up on the shore for the sick, and had a sow killed for them.
- On Monday afternoon, March 18, we saw a boat coming toward us with 9 men. Their chief went immediately to the Magellan, giving signs of joy because of our arrival.
- Five of the most ornately adorned of them remained with us, while the rest went to get some others who were fishing, and so they all came.
- Magellan saw that they were reasonable men, so he ordered food to be set before them. He gave them red caps, mirrors, combs, bells, ivory, bocasine, etc.
- When they saw Magellan's, they presented fish, a jar of palm wine, which they call uraca [i.e., arrack], figs more than one palmo long [bananas], and others which were smaller and more delicate, and two coconuts.
- They had nothing else then, but made us signs with their hands that they would bring rice, coconuts, and other food within 4 days.


### Coconuts

Coconuts are the fruit of the palm tree.

- Just as we have bread, wine, oil, and milk, so those people get everything from that tree.
- They get wine by boring a hole into the heart of the top called palmito [i.e., stalk], from which distills a liquor which resembles white must.
  - That liquor is sweet but somewhat tart, and is gathered in canes [of bamboo] as thick as the leg and thicker.
<!-- - They fasten the bamboo to the tree at evening for the morning, and in the morning for the evening. -->
- That palm bears a coconut fruit which is as large as the head.
  - Its outside husk is green and thicker than two fingers.
  - That husk has filaments which is made into a cord for binding together their boats.
  - Under that husk is a hard shell, thicker than a walnut shell
    - They burn it into a useful powder.
  - Under that shell there is a white marrowy substance one finger in thickness, which they eat fresh with meat and fish as we do bread.
    - It has a taste resembling the almond.
    - It could be dried and made into bread. 
  - There is a clear, sweet water in the middle of that marrowy substance which is very refreshing.
    - When that water stands for a while after having been collected, it congeals and becomes like an apple.
    - To make oil, they take that coconut and allow the marrowy substance and water to putrefy.
    - Then they boil it and it becomes oil like butter. 
    - When they wish to make vinegar, they allow only the water to putrefy, and then place it in the sun, and a vinegar results like that made from white wine.
  - Milk can also be made from it for we made some.
    - We scraped that marrowy substance and then mixed the scrapings with its own water which we strained through a cloth, and so obtained milk like goat’s milk.

Those palms resemble date-palms, but not smooth and are less knotty. A family of x persons can be supported on two trees, by utilizing them <!-- week about --> for wine. If they did not, then the trees would dry up. They last a century.

Those people became very familiar with us. They told us many things, their names and those of some of the islands that could be seen from that place. 

Their own island was Sulu, not very large. They were very pleasant and conversable. In order to show them greater honor, Magellan took them to his ship and showed them all his merchandise—cloves, cinnamon, pepper, ginger, nutmeg, mace, gold, and all the things in the ship.
- He had some mortars fired for them, whereat they showed great fear and tried to jump out of the ship.
- They made signs to us that those spices grew where we were going.
- When they were about to retire, they took their leave very gracefully and neatly, saying that they would return according to their promise.
