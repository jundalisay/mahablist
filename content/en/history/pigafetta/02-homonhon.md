## Homonhon

The island where we were is called **Homonhon**
- We found there two springs of the clearest water.
- We called it Acquada da li buoni Segnialli [“the Watering-place of good Signs”], for there were the first signs of gold in those districts.
- We found a lot of white coral there, and large trees with fruit a little smaller than the almond, resembling pine seeds.

There are also many palms and many islands. We called them **the archipelago of San Lazaro**, as they were discovered on the Sabbath of St. Lazurus.
- They lie in x degrees of latitude toward the Arctic Pole, and in a longitude of 161 degrees.

At noon on Friday, March 22, those men came as they had promised us in 2 boats with coconuts, sweet oranges, a jar of palm-wine, and a cock in order to show us that there were fowls in that district.
- We purchased all those articles from them. 
- Their seignior was an old tattoed man.
  - He wore two gold earrings [schione] in his ears. 
- The others were wearing many gold armlets and kerchiefs about their heads.
- We stayed there one week
  - During that time, Magellan went ashore daily to visit the sick, and every morning gave them coconut water from his own hand, which comforted them greatly.

There are people living near that island who have holes in their ears so large that they can pass their arms through them. 
- Those people are heathen. 
- They go naked, with a cloth woven from the bark of a tree about their privies, except some of the chiefs who wear cotton cloth embroidered with silk at the ends by means of a needle.
- They are dark, fat, and painted. 
- They anoint themselves with coconut and with beneseed oil, as a protection against sun and wind.
- They have very black hair that falls to the waist.
- They use daggers, knives, and spears ornamented with gold, large shields, fascines,216 javelins, and fishing nets that resemble rizali and their boats are like ours.

On the afternoon of holy Monday, March 25 we went west southwest between four small islands:
- Cenalo 
- Hiunanghan
- Ibusson
- Abarien


## Butuan (Masawa)

On Thursday morning, March 28 we saw a fire on an island the night before, so we anchored near it.
- We saw a small boat which the natives call boloto with 8 men in it, approaching the flagship.
- Magellan's slave was a native of Sumatra, which was formerly called Traprobana, spoke to them.
- They immediately understood him*, came alongside the ship, unwilling to enter but taking a position at some little distance.



{{< n n="Maharlika note: This proves that Butuan was more civilized than Homonhon (i.e. Butuan is urban, while Homonhon is rural)" >}}



Magellan saw that they would not trust us, threw them out a red cap and other things tied to a bit of wood.
- They received them very gladly, and went away quickly to advise their king.

Two hours later, we saw two balanghai [large boats] coming.
- They were full of men.

Their king, Raha Colambu, was also the king of Butuan and Calagan
- He understood Magellan's slave, since the kings there know more languages than the other people.
- He gave Magellan a large bar of gold and a basketful of ginger.
- Magellan would not accept it but thanked the king heartily

Next day, holy Friday, Magellan sent his slave ashore in a small boat to ask the king if he had any food to have it carried to the ships.
- The king came with 8 men in the same boat and entered the ship.
- He embraced Magellan to whom he gave three porcelain jars covered with leaves and full of raw rice, two very large orade, and other things.
- Magellan gave Raha Colambu:
  - a garment of red and yellow cloth made in the Turkish fashion
  - a fine red cap
  - some knives and mirrors to Colambu's men

Then Magellan:
- had a collation spread for them, and told Raha Colambu through the slave that he wanted to be their brother.
  - He agreed.
- showed him
  - cloth of various colors, linen, coral [ornaments], and many other merchandise
  - all the artillery, some of which he fired for him, which greatly frightened the natives.
- had a man armed as a soldier, and placed him in the midst of three men armed with swords and daggers, who struck him on all parts of the body. 
  - Raha Colambu was rendered almost speechless. 

Magellan said that one of those armed men was worth 100 of the Raha Colambu's men and that he had 200 men in each ship armed that way.
<!--   - The king answered that that was a fact. -->

He showed the king cuirasses, swords, and bucklers, and had a review made for him. Then he led Raha Colambu to the deck of the ship at the stern and had his sea-chart and compass brought. He told the king through the interpreter:
- how he had found the strait [of Magellan] in order to get there
- how many moons he had been without seeing land, whereat the king was astonished. 
- that he would like to send two of his men to show them some of his things. 

The king agreed. I went in with the other men.

When I reached shore, the king raised his hands toward the sky and then turned toward us two.
- The balanghai was as long as 80 of my palm lengths, and resembling a fusta.
- We sat down upon the stern of that balanghai, constantly conversing with signs.

Raha Colambu's men stood about us in a circle with swords, daggers, spears, and bucklers. 
- He had a plate of pork brought in and a large jar filled with wine. At every mouthful, we drank a cup of wine.
  - The wine that was left [in the cup] at any time, although that happened but rarely, was put into a jar by itself.
  - The king’s cup was always kept covered and no one else drank from it but he and I. 

Before Raha Colambu took the cup to drink, he raised his clasped hands toward the sky, and then toward me.
- When he was about to drink, he extended the fist of his left hand toward me (at first I thought that he was about to strike me) and then drank. 
- I did the same toward the king. They all make those signs one toward another when they drink.

Before the supper hour, I gave Raha Colambu many things. 
- I wrote down the names of many things in their language. 
- When Raha Colambu and the others saw me writing, and when I told them their words, they were all astonished.
<!-- - While engaged in that the supper hour was announced.  -->

Supper was announced and two large porcelain dishes were brought in, one full of rice and the other of pork with its gravy.
- We ate with the same signs and ceremonies, after which we went to Raha Colambu's palace which was built like a hayloft and was thatched with palm leaves. 
- It was built up high from the ground on huge posts of wood that it was only accessible by ladders.
- The king made us sit down there on a bamboo mat with our feet drawn up like tailors. 
- After a half-hour a platter of roast fish cut in pieces was brought in, and ginger freshly gathered, and wine.
- The king’s eldest son was the prince. 
  - He came over and the king told him to sit down near us.

Then two platters were brought in, one with fish and its sauce, and the other with rice. <!-- , so that we might eat with the prince. --> 
- My companion became intoxicated as a consequence of so much drinking and eating. 
- They used the gum of a tree called anime wrapped in banana leaves for lights. 

Raha Colambu made us a sign that he was going to go to sleep. 
- He left the prince with us, and we slept with the latter on a bamboo mat with pillows made of leaves. 

When day dawned, Raha Colambu came and took me by the hand to where we had had supper in order to have refreshments. But the boat came to get us. Before we left, the king kissed our hands with great joy, and we his. 


Raha Siaui, a brother of Raha Colambu and king of another island, and three men came with us. Magellan kept him to dine with us, and gave him many things.

Pieces of gold, of the size of walnuts and eggs are found by sifting the earth in Raha Siaui's island. Raha Siaui told us that all his dishes are of gold and also some portion of his house.
- According to their customs he was very grandly decked out
- He was the finest looking man that we saw among those people.
- His hair was exceedingly black, and hung to his shoulders.
- He had a covering of silk oh his head, and wore two large golden earrings.
- He wore a cotton cloth all embroidered with silk, which covered him from the waist to the knees. At his side hung a dagger, the haft of which was somewhat long and all of gold, and its scabbard of carved wood. 
- He had three spots of gold on every tooth, and his teeth appeared as if bound with gold. 
- He was perfumed with storax and benzoin. 
- He was tawny and tattooed all over.

When those kings wished to see one another, they both went to hunt in that island where we were.
