<!-- All the Contents of the Letters, and other Papers, that came from the Molucco Islands to India and the Philippines, for the following Years, amount to nothing but Complaints, asking Relief, and giving Intelligence, not altogether below the Dignity of History, were we not come so near the last Period of it. Particularly there are Letters of  -->

The Commander of Tidore was Ruy Gonzalez de Sequeyra,

<!-- to the Governor of the Philippine Islands, wherein he complains, Complaints from Tydore, and other Advice. , Ships, and Warlike Stores  -->

The Philippine Governor:
- sent 400 Men to Camboxa where his Majesty had nothing to recover.
- sent only 20 Men to him

He represents to him many pressing Wants, without any Hopes of Relief from the Viceroy, by the way of Malaca; urging the scarcity of Provisions, Arms, and all other Necessaries. 

He informs him, That through his Means Cachil Mole had been sworn King of Tydore; and how faithful a Friend he approves himself to the Crown of Sian, and an Enemy to the Ternates, and that he is always sollicitous for recovering of that Fort. 

He wanted him to send the King a Present of great Guns, and other Gifts, and to do the same by the King of Sian, who is a Christian, and our Friend. He acquaints him how frequently the English and Dutch Ships resort to those Seas, and that he had taken some of them.

The Success of a very great and rich Ship of Zealand, is most particularly Remarkable: This Vessel putting into Ternate, and Trading with [178]that Wicked Faithless King, he consented that Ruy Gonzalez should contrive Villany of the King of Ternate. to cut her Cables, provided the Booty might be his: He agreed to it, exacting an Exorbitant price for the Villany. 

The Bargain made, and the Bribe receiv’d, they who had cut the Cables leap’d over-board, and immediately the King’s Officers appear’d, who seiz’d all the Loading, the Ship being beaten to pieces, to no purpose. 

He assures him Ternate could be conquered with 400 Spaniards.

<!-- and promises to send him a great piece of Amber, as an extraordinary Rarity, from the Isles of Mava, which are 60 Leagues from the Moluccos. He again gives Advice of Northern Galeons, and that one of them, in four Hours, had batter’d that Fort, shot into it 261 Bullets; one of which he sent him; and that they had beaten down a large Curtin of the Wall, which was then Repairing. -->

English Infest the West-Indies. 

In the mean while England infested the West-Indies; where the Towns and Ships suffer’d by their Invasions, Robberies, and Burnings. 

Only that Part, which was the District belonging to Don Pedro de Acunna, defended it self, through the Bravery of its Governor, and for the same Reason the Enemy had Regard to it. William Park, the English Admiral, appear’d upon the strong and garrison’d Coasts of America, in the Year 1601. 

They defended themselves well, yet he prevail’d in some Places. 

On the Coast of Cartagena he took one Julio, a Fisherman, whom he afterwards set at Liberty, that he might carry the following Letter, writ in broken Spanish to Don Pedro.

Admiral Parke’s Letter to Don Pedro.

Being inform’d by Fame, with how much Generosity and Kindness your Lordship entertains Strangers, especially those of my Nation, I would not forbear expressing the Gratitude due to your Lordship for that Magnificence, on my own Part, and returning Thanks, wishing you as long a Life, and as much Health, as to my self. 

I would not omit writing these few Lines to your Lordship, not only on the aforesaid Account, but to acquaint you with what has happen’d to me during this Expedition. It pleas’d God to make me Master of one of the Kings Ports, call’d Porto Belo, which I was possess’d of a whole Day and Part of the Night, where I found some Gentlemen, particularly Captain Melendez, and some other Soldiers of the Garrison; and plundering the Place had very little Booty. 

The said Captain Melendez, fought like a resolute Soldier, and faithful Servant of his King, and therefore I order’d him to be dress’d by my Surgeon, and to be carry’d out of the House where he was wounded, having laid Wood in all the Houses to fire them, and consume the Town.

I do assure your Lordship, and declare on the Word of a Soldier, that being inform’d of your Valour and Renown, by certain Prisoners I took, as Captain Rolon, and several others, and at Porto Belo by the King’s Factor, Funes, and other Soldiers, that were my Prisoners, and aboard my Ship, I gave them all their Liberty, and forebore firing the City, only on Account of your Reputation, and the Fame of your good Usage to such Prisoners as fall into your Hands. 

So that those I set at Liberty, as also the Town, may be thankful to your Lordship for so great an Obligation, as is the Value of the said Town, and their Lives. 

The Castle, and the Fort at the Mouth of the Harbour, and the Port it self, so well fortify’d and furnish’d with Artillery, and all other Necessaries, did not deter, fright, or daunt me, for I went out with six Ships, and the Castles did me no Harm. Really the Commanders [179]and Guners were very honest Men. I give your Lordship Notice of two English Men, who landed at Santa Marta, near ten Months since, their Names are Abraham Collins, and Thomas Hall.

These are both Spies upon Cartagena. I like the Treason, but drown the Traitor; I send you some poor Men ashore, whom I took upon this Coast, your Lordship will favour them as is due, and according to your Custom.

Having Nothing else, at present, to acquaint your Lordship with, pray to God to lengthen your Life, with much Health, and Prosperity, and to give me good Luck, as is in his divine Power, is convenient for us, and I wish. From aboard my Ship, February the twenty eigth, 1601, our Stile. Your Lordships, William Park.

Don Pedro answer’d in few Words, yet so as his Brevity might not exclude Civility, and the Pyrate being satisfy’d, proceeded on his Voyage. 

<!-- to succeed Don Francis Don Pedro appointed -->
The King had at this Time appointed Don Pedro Tello as Governor of the Philippines. 

<!-- Tello in the Government of the Philippine Islands, designing him for those Enterprizes he afterwards perform’d. This his Majesty judg’d a proper Resolution, and safe in the Execution; for what Person is fit to be pitch’d upon to Govern the utmost Limits of so far extended a Dominion, but such a one as is endu’d with both Valour and Loyalty, two necessary Qualifications to secure the Respect and Submission due to an absent Prince; a Matter of much Difficulty in remote Governments?

Since this Gentleman’s own Actions, and the great Opinion his very Enemies had conceiv’d of them, are sufficient Testimonies of his Valour, let us proceed to say something of his Quality.  -->

Don Pedro had the Surname of Bravo, as being Son to Don Lewis Bravo, who serving under the Don Pedro’s Father.

Emperor Charles the fifth, on the Day the Prince of Orange dy’d, ask’d Leave to assault S. Desir, a strong Town in the Low Countries, on the Banks of the River Matrone. 

The History of that War informs us, that some Friends of his Father’s, hearing of it, endeavour’d to obstruct it, either by disswading the Son, or prevailing with the Emperor not to grant him Leave. 

His Father was Sancho Bravo de Lagunas, a Gentleman of Quality by Birth, and no less by his own Actions, at that Time Inspector General of the Emperor’s Forces by Sea and Land, and one of his Council of War. 

All Men honour’d, and lov’d him entirely. They consider’d he had no other Son but Don Lewis, and the manifest Danger he expos’d himself to; but he perceiving what his Fathers Friends were contriving, took upon him to lead the Van, before they could have Time to prevent his gaining the Honour he expected; and assaulted the Place with Success, tho’ not without some Imputation of Rashness. His Son Don Pedro did not degenerate, for the Brave are the Off-spring of the Brave, and the Eagle does not breed Doves.

The Name of Acunna he took from his Mother.

 <!-- Custom of the Kingdoms of Castile, where noble Families, to keep up the Honour of the Quality they acquire by Matrimony, use to revive the Names of their Progenitors even in the Grand-Children. -->

<!-- Don Lewis Bravo, marry’d Donna Isabel de Acunna, Daughter to Don Pedro de Acunna, call’d in those Days el Cabezudo, signifying, either the Head-strong, or Great-Headed, great Grand-Son to the first Earl of Buendia, a Family of known Antiquity. 

Among his Sons, Don Sancho Bravo, the eldest, is [180]now, when this History was writ, Adelantado, or Lord Lieutenant of Ternate, and Knight of the Order of Alcantara; Don Garcia, is Knight of Santiago; Don Lewis, of Calatrava; Don John, bred in the principal Colledge of Alcala, went thence to be Gentleman of the Bed-chamber to the most serene Arch-Duke Albertus, and is since Cannon of the Holy Church of Toledo, besides other Church Affairs he is always employ’d in. Our Don Pedro Knight of Malta. Don Pedro was Knight of Malta, and Commendary of Salamanca. -->

<!-- He departed Cartagena, leaving that Government disconsolate, and full of the Desire of his Continuance among them. He had a good Passage, Comes to Mexico. and being come to Mexico, and entertain’d by the Viceroy, Don Gaspar De Zunnigay Azevedo, Earl of Monterey, consulted with him about the Expedition and Recovery of the Molucco Islands, beginning with Ternate, the Head of them.  -->

They admitted to their Consultations some experienc’d Commanders in those Countries. The Result was, the Viceroy’s being well affected to the Expedition, and to the Governour, who was going to undertake it, which was of no small Consequence, towards rend’ring the Preparations made in New Spain effective. Don Pedro writ to the King, to his Confessor, to the Duke of Lerma, and to other Ministers of State, especially the supreme Councellors of the Indies, very largely, in Relation to this War, showing how difficult it was, and how great a Dishonour, to permit a Tyrant to reign so long, he being so near a Neighbour. 

He said, he could not secure any Ships, nor even the Provinces, against the Moluccos; and that, had he not been promis’d to be enabled to recover them, he would never have accepted of the Government of the Philippine Islands. He sent Brother Gaspar Gomez, a Jesuit, Arrives at the Islands Ladrones. 

With these Letters into Spain, And set out himself from Mexico, for Acapulco, the Sea-Port-Town of that Kingdom. Thence he proceeded, with four Ships of New Spain, to the Islands de los Ladrones, that is of Thieves, otherwise call’d de las Velas, or of Sails, from the great Multitude of Little Sails seen about them, belonging to Abundance of Boats that come out to meet the Ships.


He directed his Course to the Isles of Carpana, and that of Guan, that no Time might be lost without doing good to others. His Design was to bring off from among those barbarous People, such Men as had escap’d Rich Ships lost. of the Ship Margarita, cast away there the Year before, with above 1200000 Ducats; and as true Virtue never wants Matter to work on, he Twenty five Men sav’d. deliver’d twenty five Men of the many that suffer’d Shipwrack in that Place. 

Having perform’d this good Work, in twenty six Days he came to the Mouth of the Streight of the Philippines, and anchor’d at Cabite, three Don Pedro at Manila. 

Leagues from Manila; where he was receiv’d with incredible, and universal Joy. His first Care was to be inform’d of the Condition his Predecessor left the Government in. He view’d every Part, and 

He cast off the Sangleys thinking they exceeded the Number allowed of by the King’s Order.

Some interpreted the Exclusion of those People, was only to condemn the extravagant Liberties they took; but Time soon show’d, that there were other great Advantages reap’d by it.

In Don Pedro all Men believ’d the Security of the Philippine Islands was come; for the Governour’s Reputation was equal to the Necessities of his Province; which requir’d the Government of an experienc’d Commander, of great Name, and so vigilant as he was. [181]

Don Francis Tello resign’d up the Power into his Hands, and staying Don Francis Tello dyes. there to give an Account of his Administration, dyed in April, the following Year.

The new Governour found:
- the King’s Treasury empty
- he was obliged to support the King’s and his own Credit

<!-- To this Consideration belong’d the Moluccos, the reducing whereof he had in Charge.  -->

However he took Courage, believing he might with Industry and Labour, make amends for the Want of Cash.

He attended all the Works in Person, as he had been wont to do, both at Manila and in the Country about, building Galleys, and other Vessels, whereof there was then a great Want, to secure the Sea, at that Time infested Don Pedro visits his Government. by the Neighbouring Pirates and Enemies, especially those of Mindanao. 

Next he visited the Provinces of the Pintados, and supply’d the Wants he found in those Parts.

In these Passages betwixt the Islands, besides the Storms, his little Vessel, which had only three Soldiers in it, escap’d, he fell into another notable Danger.

22 English Vessels enrich’d with the Booty they had taken in the Islands belonging to that Government, attempted to inclose and take him, but the Tide failing them, they stuck on Ground, and could not get off. 

Don Pedro saw them Cruelty of English throw over-board above 2000 Spaniards and Natives they had made Prisoners, to lighten their Vessels.

They also cast into the Sea a beautiful Spanish Maid, about 17 Years of Age.

Afterwards the Fleet from Manila sail’d in quest of them, and chastis’d some, tho’ the Punishment was inferior to their Cruelty.

Don Pedro would fain have remov’d all Obstacles that lay in the Way to the Enterprize he had in Hand; but was oblig’d to put off for some Months that which he was most intent upon, and to dispatch the Affairs Japonese Embassador at Manila. of Xolo and Japan.
