A few days after the Chancillería of the Filipinas had been established in Manila, news arrived of events in Camboja after the arrival of Prauncar.

He was the son and successor of Prauncar Langara who died in Laos. 

Diego Belloso and Blas Ruyz de Hernan Gonzalez helped him to retake the throne. 

The news came in letters from King Prauncar to Governor Don Francisco Tello and Doctor Antonio de Morga.

<!-- They were signed by the king's hand and seal in red ink. The letters were written in Castilian so that they might be better understood. Since they were alike in essence, I thought it proper to reproduce here the letter written by King Prauncar to Doctor Antonio de Morga, which reads word for word as follows. -->


{{< box >}}
Prauncar, King of Camboja, to Doctor Antonio de Morga, greeting;

 <!-- to whom I send this letter with great love and joy. -->

I, Prauncar, King of the rich land of Camboja, sole lord of it, cherish an ardent love for Doctor Antonio de Morga.

Captain Chofa Don Blas told me that he came from Luzon with the Portuguese Captain Chofa Don Diego with soldiers to find King Prauncar my father.

<!-- , the Castilian, that he, from the kindness of his heart, took an active part and has assisted the governor of Luzon to send to this country Captain Chofa Don Blas, the Castilian, and   the two chofas and the soldiers -->

They searched for him in vain. But they killed Anacaparan [the usurper]. 

<!-- , who was reigning as sole great lord.  -->

Then they went with their ships to Cochinchina, whence the two chofas went to Lao to find the king.

They brought me back to my kingdom and have helped me to pacify what I now hold.

I understand that all this has come to me because of you.

<!--  and I am here now through their aid. The two chofas and other Spaniards who have come, 
the doctor loves this country.  -->

<!-- Hence I shall act so that Doctor Antonio de Morga may always love me as he did my father Prauncar, and assist me now by -->

Please send me fathers for the two chofas and the other Spaniards and Christians who dwell in my kingdom. I shall build them churches and permit them to christianize whatever Cambodians choose to become Christians.

I shall provide them with servants and I protect them as did formerly King Prauncar.

I shall provide you with whatever will be useful to you from this country.
- The two chofas have received the lands which I promised them.

To Captain Don Blas, the Castilian, I gave the province of Tran, and to Captain Chofa Don Diego, the Portuguese, the province of Bapano.

These provinces I grant and bestow upon them for the services which they have rendered me and in payment for the property they have spent in my service, so that they may possess and enjoy them as their own, and do what they will with them while in my service. [96]

Together with the king's letter was that from Blas Ruis de Hernan Gonzalez informing him of all the events of his expeditions:


{{< box >}}
To Doctor Antonio de Morga, Lieutenant-governor of the Filipinas
<!-- Islands of Luzon, in the city of Manila, whom may our Lord preserve. -->

From Camboja: Your Grace must have already heard of events in this kingdom of Camboja, from my arrival until the captain withdrew the fleet. 

<!-- These accounts will undoubtedly vary according to what each man thought fit to say in order to gild his own affairs: some according to their bent and opinion, and others according to their passion. Although the matter has been witnessed and thoroughly known by many persons, I am about to relate it as well as possible to your Grace, as to a person who can weld all the facts together and give to each circumstance the weight which it may possess and deserve. I shall also give an account among other things of all that happened to Captain Diego Belloso and myself on the journey to Lao, and the vicissitudes and wars in this kingdom, from our arrival until the condition of affairs now in force.  -->

Since Spaniards have taken part in all these events it will please your Grace to know the manner and retirement with which I have lived in this kingdom ever since my arrival here from Manila, 

I have sustained the soldiers and other men in my ship at my own expense.

<!-- keeping them in a state of discipline and honor, and never allowing them to abandon themselves to sensual pleasures; although I had no credentials for this, for Gallinato had those which the governor was to give me.  -->

<!-- I shall not discuss the why and wherefore of most of the Chinese matters, because  -->

Fray Alonso Ximenez and Fray Diego [97] witnessed some of the events.

They can tell you about:
- the war against the usurper
- Gallinato's abandonment of this kingdom when affairs had practically been settled.

Had he continued to follow up matters, half of the kingdom would today justly belong to his Majesty, and the whole of it would be under the Spaniards.

Perhaps the king himself with most of his people would have embraced Christianity.

<!-- As to Chinese matters which require most explanation I only ask your Grace to consider the kingdom which we came to help, that  -->

The Chinese had no more right in Camodia than we had.

<!-- , and that we had to try to gain reputation, not to lose it. Since  -->

We came with a warlike attitude. It was the first time that an armed Spanish force set foot on the mainland.

Was it right for us to endure insults, abuse, and contempt from a so vile race as they are, and before all these pagans? 

Was it right to endure the further action of their arguments before the usurping king, to induce him to kill us?

 <!-- their many evil and infamous reports to him concerning us, in order to induce him to grant their request; and above all their impudence in killing and disarming Spaniards and going out in the streets to spear them? -->

All this I endured very patiently in order not to disturb the land by breaking with them. This was until one day they actually tried to kill some of our men in their Parián.

 <!-- and the numbers being very unequal, they had already wounded and maltreated them.  -->

We came out at the noise and the Chinese drew up in battle array, armed with many warlike instruments, challenging us to battle, with insults and expressions of contempt.

At this juncture, what would have become of our reputation had we retired when the advantage was on their side?

We attacked and killed many of them.

We do not have security in this tyrannical kingdom which is not at all friendly to us.

We had only one ship [98] which was aground at the time.

Our artillery and provisions were ashore.

They had 6 ships and many rowboats all with 2 culverins and many men.

<!-- , both in the ships and those living in the port? [99]  -->

After war had broken out, they had all their resources while we had none.

Had they taken our lives, what reputation would the Spaniards have left in these kingdoms? 

This is why I thought it better for us to overpower them rather than to be at their mercy.

Accordingly, since the Chinese began the war, we were obliged to:
- seize their ships
- strengthen ourselves through them

Father Fray Alonso Ximenez and we thought that everything would turn out well by:
- making an embassy with presents to the king
- exculpating ourselves in this matter before him
- returning to the Chinese their ship and property if they promised peace, our persons in safety in a fort under his word

 <!-- and safe-conduct, we would the king. -->

<!-- All this was written out and signed by us. In order to carry this out,  -->

We wrote a letter in the name of the Manila governor. We delivered it 9 leguas away to the king, leaving the vessels guarded.

But when he found us there, he deprived us our boats and refused to receive the letter unless we first restored the ships.

<!-- , which went under form of embassy, or to hear us   -->

Then he immediately prepared arms and assembled many men to kill us unless we restored the ships.

<!-- , of killing us, or reducing us by force to such straits as to compel us to restore them; and after their restoration, of making an end of us all without trouble or risk to his own men. -->

He did not trust us since we were going to help [his rival king]. 

<!-- in search of, and bringing help to, him whom he had dispossessed.  -->

All this was told to us by some Christians among them, especially by a young mestizo from Malaca who lived among them and knew their language.

<!-- Therefore considering that we were already separated from our companions, and that, if we restored the ships, they could easily take ours by means of them and kill the men left in them, and then us who were in that place; also that if we waited for them to collect and attack us, they could very easily kill us:  -->

We decided to attack them first instead of waiting to be attacked, then rejoin our men.

 <!-- and assure our lives or end them by fighting. Accordingly we attacked them, and such was our good fortune -->

So we attacked and we were lucky that we killed the king in the fight.

Then we retired to our ships with great difficulty, without the loss of a single Spaniard.

We did not allow the king's house to be sacked, so that they would not say that we did this to rob him.

Then the captain and sargento-mayor, our leader, arrived.

He belittled and censured what we had done, and ridiculed our statement and that of some of the Cambodians, namely, that we had killed the usurper.

He merely collected whatever silver and gold the soldiers seized during these troubles, and everything valuable in the ships, and then to burn the ships. 

Then he drew up a report against us and dispossessed us of our ships and command, thus formulating suspicion and distrust. 

After that, he gave orders to leave the kingdom. 

He paid no heed to many Cambodians who came to speak to us when we went ashore. He told us that we might build a fortress there. 

They had a legitimate king before who was driven to Lao by the usurper. Thus, they had no king.

He told us to:
- gather wherever the most protection could be found
- continue the war

He did not accept any of our suggestions. We told him that we should rescue a kinsman of the lawful king who was imprisoned by the usurper.

In this way, the kinsman would raise men in favor of the legitimate king who would then let us take his kingdom. 

<!-- that with his support we would take possession of the kingdom, and then go to get the king.  -->

But he was deaf to all this and accordingly abandoned the kingdom, and this great opportunity was lost. 

The only thing that we could request from him after returning to sea was to go to Cochinchina to ask about the galley, since they had intended to send from Manila for that purpose.

I also offered to go to Lao by land at my own expense, in search of the king of Camboja.

<!-- , for I knew that that way led thither.  -->


As soon as we arrived in Cochinchina, the captain sent:
- Diego Belloso and myself to Lao
- Captain Gregorio de Vargas to Tunquin. 

Meanwhile he held an auction among the soldiers of everything valuable from the Chinese ships, and of what else he had taken from the soldiers.

But the men were all had no money. 

So he bought them all himself. 

 <!-- without a real, and so he had everything bought for himself, at whatever price he was pleased to give.  -->

The king of Sinoa, a province of Cochinchina, equipped us for the voyage with a good outfit, by giving us an embassy for that country, and men to accompany us on the road.

Thus we made the entire journey well provided and always highly honored and feared, as Europeans had never before been seen in those kingdoms.

We were all sick on the road. But in all our troubles we were greatly comforted by the love which the people showed towards us.

<!-- , and: by the kind reception that we met at the hands of all. Finally w -->

We reached Lanchan, the capital and the royal seat of the kingdom. 

This kingdom has a vast territory, but it is thinly populated because it has been often devastated by Pegu. 

It has mines of gold, silver, copper, iron, brass, and tin. 

It produces silk, benzoin, lac, brasil, wax, and ivory.

There are also rhinoceroses, many elephants, and horses larger than those of China.

Lao is bounded on the east by Cochinchina and on the northeast and north by China and Tartaria, from which places came the sheep and the asses that were there when I went.

Much of their merchandise is exported by means of these animals. On its west and southwest lie Pegu and Sian, and on the south and southeast, it is bounded by Camboja and Champan. [100] 

It is a rich country, and everything imported there is very expensive.

<!-- Before our arrival at Lanchan, , on account of -->

After the usurper's death, a cousin of the exiled king went there from Camboja, fearing that the usurper's son would would kill him.

He told what we had done in Camboja. This made the king of Lao receive us very cordially, and showed great respect for us. He praised our deeds and showed amazement that they had been accomplished by so few.

When we arrived, the old king of Camboja, together with his elder son and daughter, had already died.

There was left only the younger son with his mother, aunt, and grandmother.

These women rejoiced greatly over our deeds and arrival, and more attention was given them thenceforth. 

The usurping king Anacaparan sent from Camboja an ambassador to Lao. 

Before our arrival at the city, we met him and assured him of Anacaparan's death. This made him return to Camboja.  

 <!-- , in order that he might reach Lanchan before we did, and see what was going on there. -->

<!-- He feigned excuse and pretext of asking for the old queen, who was the step-mother of the dead king Prauncar, and whom Anacaparan claimed to be his father's sister. 

The king of Lao was sending her, but at our arrival, and on our assuring him of Anacaparan's death, he ordered her to return, and the ambassador, for fear of being killed, fled down the river in a boat to Camboja.  -->

Then we declared our embassy. We asked to take the heir to our ships back to Camboja.

They rejected it.
<!-- We were answered that he [i.e., the younger son] was the only one, and that they could not allow him to go, especially through a foreign country, and over such rough roads and seas. The youth wished to come, but his mothers [101] would not consent to it. Finally it was decided that  -->

Instead, we were to return to our ships and send them advices from it.

The Lao would send the heir to Camboja under a large escort.

His mothers gave me letters for Manila, asking the Spanish to pacify Camboja.

<!-- making great promises to the Spaniards  on behalf of the kingdom, if they would return to Camboja to pacify the land and restore it to them.  -->

<!-- entrusted me with another embassy, in which he petitioned for friendship and requested that the fleet return to Camboja, adding that, should -->

The king of Lao said if Gallinato was unwilling to return, he would send large forces by land to our assistance, under command of the heir.

So we left for Cochinchina.

<!-- While these things were happening in Lao, the following occurred in Camboja. As soon as the fleet had departed, the news of Anacaparan's death was published. When it was heard by  -->

Chupinaqueo, kinsman of the lawful king, escaped from his prison and incited a province to rise. He collected 6,000 men to help us make war on the sons of the usurper, who were now ruling.

<!-- , and having proclaimed Prauncar as the lawful king, came to get us with about six thousand men, in order to join us and  -->

But he could not find us in Chordemuco. 

<!-- Not finding us , where our ships had been lying, he sent boats to look for us as far as the bar. Seeing that we were nowhere to be found  the men at Champan-->

So he seized all the Chinese and other people there, and returned to his province to fortify himself.

Meanwhile, Champa army, led by Ocuña de Chu, went to Chordemuco to recover the Chinese.

Ocuña de Chu sided with the sons of the usurper.
- He proclaimed the second son Chupinanu as king because he was the most warlike.

<!-- , returned, whereupon the commander of the camp, called , took sides with  -->

 <!-- and had one of them—the second— by name, proclaimed king,   -->

<!-- This angered the first son Chupinanon.

This led to strife between them. -->

They, with the Champa army, they fought and defeated and killed Chupinaqueo.

<!--  for many days. 

 and those of his party were angered, and consequently there was continual strife between them. Then all having united, together with the army from Chanpan, 

 pursued , who came out to meet them with many of his men. They fought for many days, but at last it was Chupinaqueo's fate to be conquered and cruelly killed.  -->

Thus, for the time being Chupinanu ruled as king and the camp was disbanded.

<!-- each man going to his own home.  -->

At this time a ship arrived from Malaca on an embassy, bringing some Spaniards and some Japanese to search for us.

Chupinanu would have liked to have killed them all, but seeing that they came on an embassy, and from Malaca, he let them go immediately. 

A large province, called Tele, saw the cruelty of Chupinanu and revolted and defeated Chupinanu. 

<!-- , and declaring themselves free, proclaimed a new king; then they marched against Chupinanu, and defeated and routed him,  -->

They took from him many elephants and artillery, and sacked his city.

In the battle, most of the Spaniards and Japanese who had come from Malaca were killed.

Chupinanu retreated with all his 6 brothersto another province, always accompanied by Ocuña de Chu.

There they began to make plans and to collect men. 

They also invited 2 Malays, leaders of all the other Malays on whom Chupinanu relied strongly, who on the break-up of the camp after Chupinaqueo's death, had gone to the lands of which they were magistrates.

But in order that what follows may be understood, I will tell who these Malays are.
