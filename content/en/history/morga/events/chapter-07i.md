<!-- As soon as the ships "Jesus Maria" and "Espiritu Sancto" sailed for Nueva España, and the ship "Sanctiago" with the religious for Japon, there was more time to discuss further the matter started by the coming of the Chinese mandarins. -->

The arrival of the mandarins created a fear of the Sangleys became universal.

The people suspected that the Sangleys were about to revolt. This the archbishop and some religious affirmed and told, publicly and privately.

At this time, many Chinese were living in Manila and its environs. 

Some of them were baptized Christians living in the settlements of Baibai and Minondoc, [176] on the other side of the river, opposite the city.

Most of them were infidels, occupied and living in these same settlements and in the shops of the parián in the city. They were employed as merchants and in all other occupations. 

The majority of them were fishermen, stonecutters, charcoal-burners, porters, masons, and day-laborers.

Greater security was always felt in regard to the merchants, for they are the better class of people, and those who are most interested, because of their property.

So great security was not felt about the others, even though they were Christians; because, as they are a poor and covetous people. 

They were inclined to any act of meanness.

They would not cause any commotion unless a strong fleet from China came, which they could rely on.

Talk continued to increase daily, and with it suspicion. 

Some of the Chinese, both infidels and Christians, in order to prove themselves friends of the Spaniards told the Spaniards that there was to be an insurrection shortly.

<!-- , and clean from all guilt, even 

, and other similar things. -->

<!-- Although the governor always considered these statements as fictions and the exaggerations of that nation, and did not credit them, yet he was not so heedless that he did not act cautiously and watch, although with dissembling, for whatever might happen.  -->

The governor took pains to have the city guarded and the soldiers armed.

 <!-- besides flattering the most prominent of the Chinese and the merchants, whom he assured of their lives and property.  -->

The natives of La Pampanga and other provinces near by were instructed beforehand to:
- supply the city with rice and other provisions
- reënforce it with their persons and arms if needed

The same was done with some Japanese in the city.

As all this was done publicly. 

 <!-- with some publicity, since it could not be done secretly, as so many were concerned, one and all became convinced of the certainty of the danger. -->

Many even desired chaos to have the opportunity to seize something. [177] 

From that time, both in the city and its environs, the people began to persecute the Sangleys by word and deed. 

The natives, Japanese, and soldiers of the camp:
- took from them their possessions
- inflicted on them other ill-treatment, calling them dogs and traitors
- saying that they knew well that they meant to rebel.

But they said they would kill all the Sangleys first, and that very soon, for the governor was preparing for it. 

This alone was sufficient to make it necessary for the Sangleys to do what they had no intention of doing. [178] 

Some of the most clever and covetous made themselves leaders, the chief of whom was Joan Bautista de Vera.

He was:
- a Christian Sangley, an old-time resident in the country
- rich and highly esteemed by the Spaniards
- feared and respected by the Sangleys
- was a governor of the Sangleys
- courageous

He had:
- many godchildren and dependents
- become an excellent Spaniard

He told the Sangleys that:
- they were so numerous, that they could attack and capture the city.
- it would be easy for them to:
  - kill the Spaniards
  - seize their possessions
  - become masters of the country

They would be aided by China, as soon as the Chinese were informed. 

He exercised duplicity and cunning. He stayed in the city communicating with confidants in order to:
- assure himself better of the result
- ascertain the number of men of his race
- make a census and list of them

He cunningly had each of them ordered to bring him a needle, which he pretended to be necessary for a certain work that he had to do.
- He put these needles in a little box and counted it
- He found that he had enough men for his revolt

 <!-- did not leave the city, or the houses of the Spanish during this time, in order to arouse less suspicion of himself.  -->

 <!-- auspicious beginning that they would have made in the matter should be known.  -->

<!-- according to the determination which they saw in the Spaniards, unless they should anticipate the latter, since they [the Sangleys] . -->

They needed to build a fort and quarters in some strong place near the city.

<!-- , where the people could gather and unite, and where arms and supplies could be provided for the war.  -->

At least such a fort would be sufficient to assure there their lives from the outrages that they were expecting from the Spaniards. [179] 


They began to construct the fort immediately more than half legua from the village of Tondo, among some estuaries and swamps, in a hidden location. [180]

They stored there some rice and other provisions, and weapons of little importance.

The poor Sangleys began to gather there, these were the common people and day-laborers.

The Sangleys of the parián were mechanics and merchants.
- They were urged to do the same
- But these remained quiet, guarding their houses and property. 

<!-- The restlessness of the Sangleys daily continued to become more inflamed.

This, and the advices given to the governor and the Spaniards, kept the latter more anxious and apprehensive, and made them talk more openly of the matter.  -->
