Don Luys Dasmariñas was guarding the church and monastery of Minondoc with regulars and inhabitants of the city, under:
- Captains Don Tomas Brabo de Acuña (the governor's nephew)
- Joan de Alcega
- Pedro de Arzeo
- Gaspar Perez

<!-- , by whose counsel and advice Don Luys was to be guided on this occasion.  -->

 <!-- expected hourly that the enemy was about to attack him, and sent a messenger to the governor to beg for more men. -->


All was confusion, shouting, and outcry in the city, particularly among the natives, and the women and children, who were coming thither for safety. 

To make certain of the Sangleys of the parián, their merchants had been asked to come into the city, and bring their property.
- But they did not dare to do so.
- They always thought that the enemy would take the city because of their great force of numbers, and annihilate the Spaniards

Consequently, they preferred to remain in their parián, in order to join the victorious side.

 <!-- thought it advisable to go in search of the enemy immediately with the reënforcements sent him by the governor, before they should all assemble and present a strong front. -->

Don Luys Dasmariñas left 70 soldiers in Minondoc, in charge of Gaspar Perez.

He went on the offensive and took 140 of the best picked arquebusiers to the village of Tondo to fortify himself in the church, a stone building at 11am.

1,500 Chinese arrived for the same purpose at the same time.

An hour's skirmish took place between them for control of the monastery.

Captain Gaspar Perez came up with the reënforcement of the men left at Minondoc.

The enemy retired to his fort, with a loss of 500 men.

Gaspar Perez returned to his post, where Pedro de Arzeo was also stationed. 

<!-- Don Luys Dasmariñas, exultant over this fortunate engagement, determined immediately to press forward in pursuit of the enemy with his men, notwithstanding the heat of the sun and without waiting to rest his followers.

He sent Alferez Luys de Ybarren to reconnoiter. The latter brought word that the enemy was in great force, and near by. -->

Juan de Alcega and others requested Don Luys to halt and rest his men, and await the governor's orders as to what was to be done.

But he wanted not to lose the opportunity. So he roused his men with harsh words, in order to make them follow him, he marched forward until they reached a swamp.

After leaving the swamp, they came suddenly into a large clearing, where the enemy was stationed. The latter, upon seeing the Spaniards, surrounded them in force on all sides, armed with clubs, some with catans, and a few with battle-axes.

Don Luys and his men, not being able to retreat, fought valiantly, and killed a number of Sangleys. But finally, as the latter were in so great force, they cut all the Spaniards to pieces, only four of whom escaped, badly wounded.

<!-- These carried the news to Manila. [183]  -->

So many and the best Spanish soldiers were killed in this place. The Sangleys took their weapons and became sure of victory.

 <!-- from them, and which they needed. With these arms they flattered themselves that their object was more certain of accomplishment.  -->

Next day, October 5, the Sangleys sent the heads of Don Luys, Don Tomas, Joan de Alcega, and other captains to the parián.

They told the Sangleys there that, since the flower of Manila had been killed, they should revolt and join them, or they would immediately come to kill them.

<!-- The confusion and grief of the Spaniards in the city was so great that it prevented them from taking the precautions and exercising the diligence demanded by the affair.  -->

But the sight of their necessity, and the spirit of their governor and officials made them all remain at their posts on the walls, arms in hand.

They fortified as strongly as possible the gates of the parián and of Dilao, and all that part of the wall where the enemy might make an assault.

They mounted a piece of artillery above each gate, and stationed there the best men, among whom were religious of all the orders.

Upon that day, Sunday, the enemy, flushed with the victory of the preceding day and their army swelled by the additional men that joined them, attacked the city. 

Burning and destroying everything in their path, they went to the river, for there was no vessel with which to resist them, as all those of the fleet were in the provinces of the Pintados.

They entered the parián, [184] and furiously assaulted the city gate, but were driven back by the arquebuses and muskets, with the loss of many Sangleys.

They went to the church of Dilao, and there assaulted the gate and walls (which were there lower), by means of scaling-ladders, with the same determination.

But they experienced the same resistance and loss, which compelled them, on the approach of night, to retire with great loss to the parián and to Dilao. 

That whole night the Spaniards spent in guarding their wall, and in preparing for the morrow.

The enemy passed the night in the parián and at Dilao, making carts, mantelets, scaling-ladders, artificial fire, and other contrivances, for approaching and assaulting the wall, and for burning the gates, and setting fire to everything.

At dawn of the next day, Monday, the Sangleys came together with these arms and tools. 

They reached the wall with their bravest and best-armed men, attacked it with great fury.

The artillery destroyed their machines, and caused them so great injury and resistance with it and the arquebuses, that the Sangleys were forced to retire again to the parián and to Dilao, with heavy loss.

Joan Xuarez Gallinato, accompanied by some soldiers and a Japanese troop, made a sally from the Dilao gate on the Sangleys. 

They reached the church, when the Sangleys turned on them and threw the Japanese into disorder.

The latter were the cause of all retreating again to seek the protection of the walls, whither the Sangleys pursued them.

Then Captain Don Luys de Velasco entered Manila. 

He came from the Pintados in a stout caracoa, manned by some good arquebusiers, while others manned some bancas that sailed in the shelter of the caracoa.

They approached the parián and Dilao by the river, and harassed the enemy quartered there on that and the two following days, so that they were compelled to abandon those positions.

These vessels set fire to the parián, and burned everything, and pursued the enemy wherever they could penetrate.

The Sangleys, upon beholding their cause waning, and their inability to attain the end desired, resolved to retire from the city, after having lost more than 4,000 men; to advise China, so that that country would reënforce them. 

For their support to divide their men into 3 divisions in different districts:

1. The Tingues of Pasig
2. Those of Ayonbon
3. La Laguna de Bay, San Pablo, and Batangas

On Wednesday they abandoned the city completely, and, divided as above stated, marched inland. 


Don Luys de Velasco, with some soldiers and armed Indians who came from all sides to the relief of Manila, accompanied by some Spaniards who guided them, and the religious from their missions.

They went by the river in pursuit and were able to kill and annihilate the bands bound for the Tingues of Pasig and for Ayombon. 

The majority and main body of the Sangleys went to La Laguna de Bay, the mountains of San Pablo, and Batangas, where they considered themselves more secure. 

Burning towns and churches, and everything in their path, they fortified themselves in the above-mentioned sites. 

Don Luys de Velasco, with 70 soldiers, continued to pursue them, killing each day many.

On one occasion Don Luys was so closely engaged with the enemy, that the Sangleys killed him and 10 soldiers of his company, and fortified themselves again in San Pablo and Batangas, where they waited for reinforcements from China. [185]

To finish the enemy, the governor sent Captain and Sargento-mayor Cristoval de Axqueta Menchaca on October 12 with:
- 200 Spanish soldiers and volunteers
- 300 Japanese
- 1,500 Pampanga and Tagál natives [186]

With little or no loss of men, he killed and destroyed all Sangleys fortified in San Pablo and Batangas except for 200 who were taken alive to Manila for the galleys.

The captain was occupied in this for 20 days, and with it the war was ended.

Very few merchants were left in Manila, and they had taken the good counsel to betake themselves, with their possessions, among the Spaniards in the city. 

At the start of the war, less than 700 Spaniards in the city had arms. [187]

After the end of the war, the need of the city began, for, because of not having Sangleys who worked at the trades, and brought in all the provisions, there was no food, nor any shoes to wear, not even at excessive prices. 

The native Indians are very far from exercising those trades, and have even forgotten much of farming, and the raising of fowls, cattle, and cotton, and the weaving of cloth, which they used to do in the days of their paganism and for a long time after the conquest of the country. [188] 

In addition to this, people thought that Chinese vessels would not come to the islands with food and merchandise, on account of the late revolution. 

Above all, they lived not without fear and suspicion that, instead of the merchant vessels, an armed fleet would attack Manila, in order to avenge the death of their Sangleys. All conspired to sadden the minds of the Spaniards.
