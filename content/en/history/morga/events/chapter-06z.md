The affairs of Maluco continued to get worse because the ruler of Terrenate openly waged war against:
- his neighbor Tidore 
- the Portuguese in Tidore

He had allowed some ships which had come to Terrenate from the islands of Holanda and Zelanda by way of India to trade with him.

Through them, he had sent a message to England and to the prince of Orange, concerning peace, trade, and commerce with the English and the Dutch.

He had received a favorable reply. He expected shortly a large fleet from England to defeat Tidore and the Filipinas.

<!-- , with whose help he expected to accomplish great things against -->

Meanwhile, he kept some Flemings and Englishmen in Terrenate who had remained as pledges, and a factor engaged in purchasing cloves.

These people had brought many fine weapons for this trade, so that the island of Terrenate was exceedingly well supplied with them.

The king of Tidore and the chief captain wrote yearly to the governor of the Filipinas, informing him of what was going on so that he would help them.

Once, Cachilcota, [146] brother of the king of Tidore, a brave soldier and one of the most famous of all Maluco, came to Manila for that purpose. 

They always received men, provisions, and some ammunition. 

But they really wanted an expedition against Terrenate, before the English and Dutch came.

This could not be done without an order from his Majesty, and great preparation and equipment for such an enterprise.

The same message was always sent from Tidore.

<!-- At last, during this administration of Don Francisco Tello, Captain Marcos Dias de Febra returned with this request, and brought letters to the governor and to the Audiencia from the king [of Tidore], and from the chief captain, Rui Gonçales de Sequeira, in which were detailed contemporaneous events, and the necessity of at least sending succor to Tidore.  -->

The king wrote specially about this to the king of España and to Doctor Antonio de Morga:

<!-- , with the latter of whom he used to correspond, the following letter, which was written in Portuguese and signed in his own language. -->

To Doctor Morga, in the Filipinas Islands, from the king of Tidore.

I greatly rejoiced in receiving a letter from your Grace written on the eighth of November last, because by it I particularly understand your great sincerity in remembering me and my affairs; for this, may God reward your Grace with long life and prosperity for the service of the king, my sovereign.

I understood that he keeps your Grace in these islands with the hope of their increase, and I am aware that your being there will serve as a remedy for this fortress and island of Tidore. I have written to the governor and to the Audiencia in Manila, concerning the succor for which I beg, for I have asked it so often, on account of the great necessity of it; for through its means the injury may be checked; otherwise it may later cost much to the king our sovereign.

I beg your Grace to favor me in this, or at least in what may be necessary for the future, for thus it will render a great service to God and to the king, my sovereign. May God preserve your Grace with life for many years. 

From Tidore, March 8, 1601.

THE KING OF TIDORE

The bearer, namely, Marcos Dias, will give your Grace a flagon and a little flask of Moorish brass workmanship. I send them in order that your Grace may remember this your friend. [147]

Marcos Dias returned to Tidore at the first monsoon, in the start of 1602, bearing an answer to his message, and taking the reënforcements that had been asked, of provisions, ammunition, and a few soldiers.

He was satisfied therewith, until a fitting opportunity should offer for making the desired expedition from Manila.

Of the government of Don Pedro de Acuña, governor and president of the Filipinas, and of what happened during his administration, until his death in June 1606, after his return to Manila from Maluco, where he had completed the conquest of the islands subject to the king of Terrenate.
