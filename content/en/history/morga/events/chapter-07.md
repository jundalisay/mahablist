In May 1602, 4 ships came to Manila from Nueva España with Don Pedro de Acuña.

He would be a new governor and president of the Audiencia.

He was knight of the Order of St. John, comendador of Salamanca, and lately governor of Cartagena in Tierra Firme.

<!-- He was received into the government to the great satisfaction of the whole country, on account of the need there of one who would be as skilled in matters of war as watchful and careful in the government. , his predecessor, awaiting his residencia which was to be taken, had to remain in Manila until the following year, six hundred and three, and in the month of  he died of an acute illness. -->

Don Francisco Tello died in April 1603 due to illness.

De Acuña saw things so unstable and of so limited resources in the royal treasury.

He was worried that his reputation for solving things would be tarnished. 

 <!-- for the purpose, found that his lot was not so good as he had imagined when he had been appointed; since the state of affairs obliged him to risk a part of his reputation without his being able to remedy matters as quickly as was to be desired. -->

<!-- He took heart as much as possible, however, and without sparing himself any personal labor in whatever presented itself, he began with what was to be done in Manila and its environs. -->

He began to construct galleys and other vessels in the shipyard, for there was great need of these, in order to defend the sea, which was full of enemies and pirates especially from Mindanao. 

 <!-- provinces of Pintados, in order -->

He discussed going immediately in person to visit the Visayas to supply quickly their needs which was causing the greatest anxiety..

But he had to postpone that several months to arrange for:
- the despatch of Japon and Jolo matters and
- the ships going to Nueva España

<!-- , all of which came at once and had to be seen to. -->

Chiquiro, the Japanese, arrived in Manila and delivered his message to Governor de Acuña, who had been in the government but a few days.

<!-- The matter and its determination, together with the reply, were immediately considered. 

It required the greatest amount of thought to decide how this was to be made, in the most fitting manner possible. -->

Friendship with Daifusama was profitable. 

<!-- a good thing and of great profit, and a necessity to obtain and conclude, even should certain difficulties have to be overcome; and although the sailing to Quanto and its commerce were not of much account to the Spaniards; nevertheless those things would be fulfilled by sending a ship there with some goods for exchange.  -->

But the rest, namely, the trade and friendship with Nueva España, and the 

Daifu insisted on sending of masters and workmen to build ships in Japon for that navigation to Nueva Espana. 

 <!-- and which Fray Geronymo had assured him would be done, was a serious matter and impossible to be carried out, as it was very harmful and prejudicial to the Filipinas. -->

The greatest security of the Spaniards from Japon was the Japanese' lack of ships and their ignorance of navigation.

<!-- As often as the latter had intended to attack Manila, they had been prevented by this obstacle.  -->

<!-- Now to send the Japanese workmen and masters to make Spanish ships for them and show them how such vessels were made, would be to give them the weapons that they needed for their own [i.e., the Filipinas'] destruction, while their navigation to Nueva España, and making long voyages, would cause very great troubles. [148]  -->

<!-- Each matter singly was of great importance and consideration, and such that the governor could not decide them, and they could not be decided in Manila, without informing his Majesty and the latter's viceroy of Nueva España, who was so much concerned, thereof.

In order to take measures in the matter, and not to delay the Japanese from returning with his reply,  -->

A moderate present of Spanish articles was sent to Daifu, in the same ship which had come, in return for what it had brought.

These Fray Geronymo was to give Daifu in person.

<!-- The former was written to tell Daifu with what pleasure the governor received the good-will that he manifested to him, and the peace and friendship with the Spaniards, and all the other things that he was doing for them; and that he, the governor, would keep it and observe it in so far as he was concerned, and that very year  -->

The Governor said:
- he would send a Spanish ship to trade at Quanto according to Daifu's desire.
- he had no power to decide whether he could send master shipbuilders

<!-- , and that he would despatch it quickly. -->

<!-- As to the navigation which the latter wished to undertake to Nueva España and his desire to have masters sent him for that purpose, to build ships for that voyage, that was a matter which—although the governor would do his best to effect, and to please him in everything—was not within his control, without first informing his Majesty and the latter's viceroy in Nueva España thereof; 

for he, the governor, had no power or authority outside of the affairs of his government of the Filipinas. He said that he would write and would treat of it immediately, and hoped that it would be properly settled there.  -->

<!-- Until the reply came from España, which would necessarily have to be delayed three years, because that country was so far, he begged Daifu to be patient and suffer it, since it was not in his control, and nothing else could be done.

The governor wrote Fray Geronymo to humor Daifu in everything, with the best words he could use to please him, but not to embarrass himself thenceforward by promising him and expediting such things for him.  -->

With this despatch, Chiquiro sailed for Japon with his ship. But he got wrecked off the head of Hermosa Island, and neither the vessel nor its crew escaped.

News thereof was not received in Manila or in Japon until many days afterward.

Fray Geronymo de Jesus arrived in Japon and wrote of the changed conditions in Japon.

Daifu gave permission to Fray Geronymo de Jesus to make Christians and build churches. 

And so the orders of St. Francis, St. Dominic, and St. Augustine went to Japan from Manila in Japanese ships which traded with flour.

 <!-- and captains which were then at Manila, having come with flour, and which were about to return.  -->

The Order of St. Dominic sent to the kingdom of Zazuma 4 religious under Fray Francisco de Morales, [149] Prior of Manila, in a ship about to go to that island and province. 
- They said that they had been summoned by its king, the only one who had not yet rendered homage to Daifusama. 

The Order of St. Augustine sent 2 religious to the kingdom of Firando in a ship which had come from that port, under Fray Diego de Guebara, [150] Prior of Manila, because they had heard that they would be well received by its king. 

The Order of St. Francis, in the ships about to sail to Nangasaqui, sent Fray Augustin Rodrigues, [151] who had been in Japon before with the martyrs, and a lay-brother, with orders to go to Miaco, to become associates of Fray Geronymo de Jesus.

<!-- Although some difficulties presented themselves to the governor in regard to the departure of these religious from Manila, and their going to Japon so hastily, yet on account of the great pressure which they brought to bear upon him, these were not sufficient to cause him to refuse them the permission which they requested. -->

The religious were received by the provinces:
- more coolly than expected
- with fewer conveniences than they needed for support
- with less inclination for conversion

<!-- , in which they had imagined that they were to have great and immediate results, for  -->

Very few of the Japanese became Christians.

In fact, the kings and tonos of those provinces kept them to allow intercourse and commerce with the Spaniards.

They were not interested in the religion.

Governor de Acuña sent out a medium-sized ship "Santiago el Menor" [i.e., St. James the Less], with a captain and the necessary seamen and officers, and some goods of:
- red wood [152] 
- deerskins
- raw silk [153]
- other things.

It was to go to Kanto where it would find discalced Franciscan religious and sell its goods and return with the exchange.

<!-- —and with the permission of Daifusama—to Manila. -->

Thus Japanese matters were provided for, as far as seemed necessary, according to the state of affairs.

Daifusama waited for Chiquiro who did not return. 

<!-- , his servant, whom he had sent to Manila with the letters from Fray Geronymo de Jesus, pressed the latter so closely concerning the things which he desired and about which he had treated with him, that Fray Geronymo, seeing that Chiquiro was slow in returning, and that few arguments were of avail with Daifu, in order to satisfy him the better, requested permission of him to go to Manila in person, there to communicate and conclude matters with the governor by word of mouth, and bring a reply to him.  -->

He said that he would keep Fray Augustin Rodriguez and another companion hostage until Chiquiro returned. 

He allowed Fray Geronymo came to return quickly to Manila.

, where he learned of the message which Chiquiro had taken. Then he began to treat with Governor Don Pedro de Acuña, about his business, saying that Chiquiro had not yet arrived in Xapon, which gave rise to the suspicion that he had been wrecked.

The ship sent by the governor being unable to double the head of Xapon in order to pass to the north side, put into the port of Firando, where the religious of St. Augustine had had a station for a short time, and anchored there.

Thence the captain advised the court of Miaco that he had been unable to reach Quanto. He sent also the letters for the religious and what was to be given to Daifu.

The religious, Fray Geronymo's associates, gave Daifu the presents which were for him, and told him that the governor was sending that ship at his disposition and command, but that the weather had not allowed it to reach Quanto. 

Daifusama received the presents, although he did not believe what they told him, but that they were compliments to please him. He ordered the ship to get its trading done immediately, and to return with some things which he gave them for the governor, and thenceforward to go to Quanto as promised him.

Thereupon it returned to Manila.

Fray Geronymo de Jesus reached the Filipinas so quickly that he had opportunity to treat with Governor Don Pedro de Acuña, about the matters under his charge, from whom he received the promise that ships would continue to be sent to Quanto to please Daifusama.

Taking with him a good present, given him by the governor, consisting of a very rich and large Venetian mirror, glass, clothes from Castilla, honey, several tibores, [154] and other things which it was known would please Daifu, he returned immediately to Japon. 

He was well received there by Daifu, to whom he communicated his message, and that his servant Chiquiro had been well sent off by the new governor, and that nothing less than shipwreck was possible, since he had not appeared in so long a time.

He gave Daifu what he had brought, which pleased the latter greatly.
