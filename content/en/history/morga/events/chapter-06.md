<!-- Of the administration of , and of the second establishment of the Audiencia of Manila; and of occurrences during the period of this administration. -->


At the start of 1596:
- Captain Juan Xuarez Gallinato made a voyage to Camboja 
- Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa made a voyage to Mindanao

In June 1596, news reached Manila that 2 ships had entered the islands by the channel of Espiritu Santo with a new governor, Don Francisco Tello de Guzman, sent from España.

Don Francisco Tello de Guzman was:
- a knight of the Order of Sanctiago
- a native of Sevilla
- treasurer of the India House of Trade. 

He arrived at Manila at the start of July and entered on his office.

Fray Ygnacio Sanctivañez was:
- of the Order of St. Francis
- a native of Sanctivañez in the province of Burgos

He had been nominated in Nueva España as archbishop of Manila because Bishop Fray Domingo de Salazar had died in Madrid.

Fray Miguel de Venavides was:
- a native of Carrion
- a religious of the Order of St. Dominic

De Venavides had gone to España with Bishop Fray Domingo de Salazar had been appointed bishop of the city of Segovia in the province of Cagayan.

Fray Pedro de Agurto was:
- of the Order of St. Augustine
- a native of Mexico

De Agurto had been appointed in Mexico, bishop of the city of Sanctisimo Nombre de Jesus.

<!-- , who was not yet named, -->
These two bishops with another were appointed for the city of Caceres, in the province of Camarines.

Camarines had been lately:
- added to the Filipinas
- appointed as suffragans to the archbishop of Manila, at the instance of Bishop Fray Domingo. 

The Audiencia which had been suppressed in Manila was to be reëstablished there, as well as other things which the bishop had presented at court.

Shortly after Don Francisco Tello took over the governorship, news came of the death of Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa in Mindanao, by Brother Gaspar Gomez of the Society of Jesus.

Gaspar Gomez brought the body for burial in the college of Manila, of which Don Estevan was patron. 

Don Estevan had left behind:
- his wife, Doña Ana de Osseguera
- 2 small daughters
- house and property

Juan de la Xara* wrote that:
- he had charge of affairs
- he had settled in Tampacan
- he intended to continue the pacification and conquest of the island
- reënforcements of men and other things should be sent him.

{{< n n="The captain left to defend Manila" >}}

It was learned that he:
- intended to make an ill use of the government
- would not remain dependent on, and subordinate to, the governor of the Filipinas
- was depriving the heirs of Estevan Rodriguez of what lawfully belonged to them.

De la Xara was sending his confidants to the town of Arevalo in Oton to persuade Doña Ana to marry him.

<!-- It was learned that, in order to make himself safer in this respect, he was  -->

This decision was injurious in many respects, and the attempt was made to rectify matters.

But in order not to disturb the affairs of Mindanao, the matter was left alone for the present.

<!-- , until time should show the course to be followed. -->

And so Juan de la Xara:
- left the camp and settlements of Mindanao
- came hurriedly to Oton to negotiate his marriage in person
  - This is even if the widow of Don Estevan never wanted it

Don Francisco Tello sent men to arrest him. He was brought to Manila, where he died while his trial was being conducted.

After the imprisonment of Juan de La Xara, Don Francisco Tello immediately sent Captain Toribio de Miranda to Mindanao, with orders to take command of the camp and to govern, until some one should agree to continue the enterprise.

When he arrived at Mindanao, the soldiers saw that:
- Juan de La Xara's schemes had been defeated
- De La Xara was a prisoner in Manila, with no hope of returning

So they obeyed Toribio de Miranda.

<!-- In Manila the governor was considering carefully the necessary measures for continuing the war, since  -->

The island of Mindanao:
- was so near the other pacified islands.
- had some provinces that professed peace and were apportioned as encomiendas and had Spanish magistrates:
  - These were the rivers of Butuan, Dapitan, and Caragan

The whole of Mindanao had to be pacified. 

The royal treasury was spent and could not bear the expense.

Estevan Rodriguez had bound himself by a legal writ, to fund the war at his own expense.

<!-- , in accordance with the terms of his agreement. -->

The guardian of his children and heirs brought the matter before the court and refused to fulfil this obligation because of Estevan Rodriguez's death.

<!-- In order not to lose time, for what had been commenced had to be continued in one way or another,  -->

The governor decided to prosecute it, drawing the necessary funds from the royal treasury, either on its own account or on the account of Estevan Rodriguez's heirs, if such should be according to law.
