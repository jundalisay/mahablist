While these things were happening in Camboja and Cochinchina, orders had arrived from España from his Majesty to conclude an agreement that Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa had made with , 

Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa had agreed with Gomez Perez Dasmariñas to pacify and settle the island of Mindanao at his own expense in exchange for governorship of the island for 2 lives [58] and other rewards. 

Don Estevan Rodriguez prepared men and ships (galleys, galleots, frigates, vireys, barangays, and lapis), [59] and set out with 214 Spaniards for Mindanao in February of the 1596.

He took Captain Juan de la Xara as his master-of-camp, and some religious of the Society of Jesus to give instruction, as well as many natives for the service of the camp and fleet.

He reached Mindanao River, after a good voyage, and reached the first settlements, Tancapan and Lumaguan. These received him peacefully and joined his fleet as they were hostile to the people of Buhahayen.

They were altogether around 6,000 men. 

Without delay they advanced about 8 leguas farther up the river against Buhahayen, the principal settlement of the island, where its greatest chief had fortified himself on many sides. 

<!-- Arrived at the settlement, the fleet cast anchor, and immediately landed a large proportion of the troops with their arms. But before reaching the houses and fort, and while going through some thickets [çacatal] [60] near the shore,  -->

They landed and encountered some of the men of Buhahayen, who were coming to meet them with their campilans, carazas [61] and other weapons, and who attacked them on various sides. 

The latter [i.e., the Spaniards and their allies], on account of the swampiness of the place and the denseness of the thickets [çacatal], could not act unitedly as the occasion demanded, although the master-of-camp and the captains that led them exerted themselves to keep the troops together and to encourage them to face the natives. 

Meanwhile Governor Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa was watching events from his flagship, but not being able to endure the confusion of his men, seized his weapons and hastened ashore with three or four companions, and a servant who carried his helmet, in order that he might be less impeded in his movements. 

But as he was crossing a part of the thickets [çacatal] where the fight was waging, a hostile Indian stepped out unseen from one side, and dealt the governor a blow on the head with his campilan, that stretched him on the ground badly wounded. [62]

The governor's followers cut the Mindanao to pieces and carried the governor back to the camp. 

Shortly after, the master-of-camp, Juan de la Xara, withdrew his troops to the fleet, leaving behind several Spaniards who had fallen in the encounter. The governor did not regain consciousness, for the wound was very severe, and died next day. 

The fleet after that loss and failure left that place, and descended the river to Tampacan, where it anchored among the friendly inhabitants and their settlements.

The master-of-camp, Juan de la Xara, had himself chosen by the fleet as successor in the government and enterprise. 

He built a fort with arigues and palms near Tampacan, and founded a Spanish settlement which he named Murcia. 

He began to make what arrangements he deemed best, in order to establish himself and run things independently of, and without acknowledging the governor of Manila, without whose intervention and assistance this enterprise could not be continued.

Of the administration of Don Francisco Tello, and of the second establishment of the Audiencia of Manila; and of occurrences during the period of this administration.
