The language of all the Pintados and Biçayas is one and the same, by which they understand one another when talking, or when writing with the letters and characters of their own which they possess.

These resemble those of the Arabs. The common manner of writing among the natives is on leaves of trees, and on bamboo bark.

Throughout the islands the bamboo is abundant; it has huge and misshapen joints, and lower part is a very thick and solid tree. [305]

The language of Luzon and those islands in its vicinity differs widely from that of the Bicayas. [306] 

The language of the island of Luzon is not uniform, for the Cagayans have one language and the Ylocos another.

The Zambales have their own particular language, while the Pampangos also have one different from the others.

The inhabitants of the province of Manila, the Tagáls, have their own language, which is very rich and copious.

By means of it one can express elegantly whatever he wishes, and in many modes and manners. It is not difficult, either to learn or to pronounce.

The natives throughout the islands can write excellently with certain characters, almost like the Greek or Arabic. These characters are fifteen in all. 

Three are vowels, which are used as are our five. The consonants number twelve, and each and all of them combine with certain dots or commas, and so signify whatever one wishes to write, as fluently and easily as is done with our Spanish alphabet. The method of writing was on bamboo, but is now on paper, commencing the lines at the right and running to the left, in the Arabic fashion. Almost all the natives, both men and women, write in this language. There are very few who do not write it excellently and correctly.

This language of the province of Manila [i.e., the Tagál] extends throughout the province of Camarines, and other islands not contiguous to Luzon. 

There is but little difference in that spoken in the various districts, except that it is spoken more elegantly in some provinces than in others. [307]

The edifices and houses of the natives of all these Filipinas Islands are built in a uniform manner, as are their settlements; for they always build them on the shores of the sea, between rivers and creeks. 

The natives generally gather in districts or settlements where they sow their rice, and possess their palm trees, nipa and banana groves, and other trees, and implements for their fishing and sailing. 

A small number inhabit the interior, and are called tinguianes; they also seek sites on rivers and creeks, on which they settle for the same reasons.

The houses and dwellings of all these natives are universally set upon stakes and arigues [i.e., columns] high above the ground. 

Their rooms are small and the roofs low. They are built and tiled with wood and bamboos, [308] and covered and roofed with nipa-palm leaves. Each house is separate, and is not built adjoining another. 

In the lower part are enclosures made by stakes and bamboos, where their fowls and cattle are reared, and the rice pounded and cleaned. One ascends into the houses by means of ladders that can be drawn up, which are made from two bamboos. 

Above are their open batalanes [galleries] used for household duties; the parents and [grown] children live together. There is little adornment and finery in the houses, which are called bahandin. [309]

Besides these houses, which are those of the common people and those of less importance, there are the chiefs' houses. 

They are built upon trees and thick arigues, with many rooms and comforts. They are well constructed of timber and planks, and are strong and large. 

They are furnished and supplied with all that is necessary, and are much finer and more substantial than the others. 

They are roofed, however, as are the others, with the palm-leaves called nipa. These keep out the water and the sun more than do shingles or tiles, although the danger from fires is greater.

The natives do not inhabit the lower part of their houses, because:
- they raise their fowls and cattle there
- of the damp and heat of the earth
- the many rats, which are enormous and destructive both in the houses and sowed fields
- their houses are generally built on the sea shore, or on the banks of rivers and creeks, the waters bathe the lower parts

<!-- , and the latter are consequently left open. -->

### Governance

There were no kings or lords throughout these islands who ruled over them as in the manner of our kingdoms and provinces. But in every island, and in each province of it, many chiefs were recognized by the natives themselves. 

Some were more powerful than others. Each one had his followers and subjects, by districts and families. These obeyed and respected the chief.

Some chiefs had friendship and communication with others, and at times wars and quarrels. [310]

These principalities and lordships were inherited in the male line and by succession of father and son and their descendants. If these were lacking, then their brothers and collateral relatives succeeded.

Their duty was to:
- rule and govern their subjects and followers
- assist them in their interests and necessities.

What the chiefs received from their followers was to be held by them in great veneration and respect. They were served in their wars and voyages, and in their tilling, sowing, fishing, and the building of their houses.

To these duties the natives attended very promptly, whenever summoned by their chief. 

They also paid the chiefs tribute (which they called buiz), in varying quantities, in the crops that they gathered. 

The descendants of such chiefs, and their relatives, even though they did not inherit the lordship, were held in the same respect and consideration. 

Such were all regarded as nobles, and as persons exempt from the services rendered by the others, or the plebeians, who were called timaguas. [311] 

The same right of nobility and chieftainship was preserved for the women, just as for the men. When any of these chiefs was more courageous than others in war and upon other occasions, such a one enjoyed more followers and men; and the others were under his leadership, even if they were chiefs. 

These latter retained to themselves the lordship and particular government of their own following, which is called barangai among them. They had datos and other special leaders [mandadores] who attended to the interests of the barangay.

The superiority of these chiefs over those of their barangai was so great that they held the latter as subjects.

They treated these well or ill, and disposed of their persons, their children, and their possessions, at will, without any resistance, or rendering account to anyone. 

For very slight annoyances and for slight occasions, they were wont to kill and wound them, and to enslave them.

The chiefs have made perpetual slaves of persons who:
- have gone by them while bathing in the river, or
- have raised their eyes to look at them less respectfully 
- other similar causes. [312]
