<!-- Whatever we attacked, we conquered with God's assistance, but where we did not go, losses always resulted. 

Consequently we gained great reputation and were esteemed by our friends and feared by the enemy. -->

Ocuña de Chu was now called manbaray, the highest title in the kingdom. He tried to revolt.
- He was aided by one of the Malay chiefs called Cancona.

The king told me that manbaray was trying to kill him and set me against him.

<!--  summoned me and ordered me to bring with me the Spaniards of my party. He ordered Diego Belloso to remain, for both of us were leaders and still are, in any war in which any of us is engaged. 

I came at his bidding, and he told me that those men were trying to kill him and deprive him of his kingdom, and asked me to prevent such a thing.  -->

The mambaray was the actual ruler of the kingdom.

The king was young and addicted to wine. He held the latter in little esteem and considered himself as king. 

I, aided by Spaniards, killed mambaray, his sons, Cancona.

Then we returned to the war. 

<!-- I learned that another grandee who was head of a province was trying to rebel and join Chupinannon.

I captured him and after trying him, put him to death. 

Therefore the king showed great esteem for us, and the kingdom feared us; that province was subdued and we returned to the king. 

A vessel arrived from Sian, and ported here on its way to an embassy at Manila.

On board this vessel were father Fray Pedro Custodio and some Portuguese. 

The king was greatly delighted at the arrival of the father and wished to build him a church. 

We all united and continued the war. 

Again we returned, after having reduced many provinces to the obedience of the king, and left Chupinanon secluded on some mountains, thus almost ending the war.  -->

Then 6,000 Lao men arrived under the leadership of one of their king's relatives.*

{{< n n="Maharlika Note: The Lao came as revenge for killing Cuna de Chu" >}}

<!-- , for hitherto they had done nothing nor uttered any sound. -->

<!-- I do not know whether it was from envy at seeing us so high in the king's favor and that of the people of the kingdom, or whether they decided the matter beforehand in their own country;  -->

They killed a Spaniard with but slight pretext. 

We asked the king for justice and he ordered his mandarins to judge the case.

Meanwhile we sent for the Japanese who were at war in another region to take vengeance for us if justice were not done.

<!-- , either fearing this, or purposing to make an end of us, -->
The Lao attacked our quarters at night and killed the father and several Spaniards who had accompanied him and who were sick.

They also killed some Japanese, for their anger was directed against all. 

The rest of us escaped and took refuge on the Japanese vessel, where we defended ourselves until the arrival of the Japanese. 

The Lao made a fort and strengthened themselves therein. 

<!-- There were about six thousand of them. -->

The Lao would not agree to any act by the King. 

 <!-- of justice which he might order to be carried out.  -->

The king was very angry for:
- the deaths that the Lao had caused
- their disrespect

The Cambojan king refused to give us forces to attack the Lao. 

 <!-- with which to attack them, although we often requested him to do so; nor did we attack them ourselves, as we were without weapons. -->

<!-- The king sent word of this affair to Lao, and we remained for the time, stripped, without property, without arms, without justice or revenge, and quite angry at the king, 

although he was continually sending us excuses, saying that if the king of Lao did not do justice in this matter, he himself would do it, and would not let them leave the country on that account; he also sent us food, and some clothes and weapons. -->

At this juncture a ship was despatched on an embassy to Malaca in which we wished to embark, but neither the king nor his mothers would allow Diego Belloso or me to leave.

Some of the Spaniards embarked in it, some returned to Sian, and others remained with us.

The king from that time on made us more presents than ever.

The Japanese gathered in their ship, and refused to continue the war.

<!-- When the enemy learned that we were in confusion, they collected large forces and regained many undefended regions. -->

The king requested the Laos to go to war against Chupinanon, the eldest son of the usurper.

<!-- , since they had thrown into confusion those who were defending his country. -->

They went, lost the first battle, and returned completely routed, leaving many dead and wounded on the field.

Chupinanon followed up the victory and came within sight of the king's residence, only a river separating them.

The king then abandoned the Lao and persuaded us and the Japanese to take up arms again and defend him.

<!-- ourselves with arms and ammunition, and after much entreaty from him and his mothers, we went to war and -->
We reëquipped relieved a fortress which Chupinanon was besieging. 

We won 2 battles and forced him to withdraw.

<!-- thus taking from him all he had just regained, as well as other lands which had remained in those regions.  -->

We captured a quantity of rice and provisions from the enemy—with which the king's forces recuperated themselves, for they were suffering famine—and we went into quarters.

This we did, I, the Spaniards, and the Japanese who were on my side. 

Diego Belloso and his men went to Tele, killed its king, and returned after having conquered part of the province. 

At this time a Portuguese ship arrived from Macao, [103] laden with merchandise. 

The Lao then feared us and went back to Lao.

 <!-- without leave from the king, departed in boats to their country.  -->

Went asked the king to punish them unless he wished to break friendship with Luzon and Malaca. 

He replied that he did not dare detain them, but that if we wished to pursue and dared to fight them, he would secretly give us men.

We all negotiated for ten praus, and followed them.

<!-- WBut since they were far ahead of us and under the spell of fear, we could not overtake them for many days. For this reason Belloso turned back with some Spaniards and Japanese.  -->

<!-- I followed with great difficulty—on account of certain strong currents, for we dragged the praus part way with ropes—although with but few men, until  -->

I overtook many of the Laos, and seized their praus and possessions, from which we all received compensation and gained still more in reputation.

<!-- , which at present we enjoy to a higher degree than was ever enjoyed by any nation in foreign lands. We are greatly esteemed by the king and his men, and by those native here; and greatly feared by foreigners.  -->

<!-- Accordingly we receive great respect in all parts of the kingdom.  -->
