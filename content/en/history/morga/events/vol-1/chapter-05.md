As soon as Gomez Perez Dasmariñas reached the Filipinas, he was received as governor with universal acclaim. 

He suppressed the Audiencia. The residencias of its president, auditors, fiscal, and other officials were taken by Licentiate Herver del Coral, whom Viceroy Don Luys de Velasco had sent for that purpose, by virtue of a royal decree. 

The new governor inaugurated his rule by:
- establishing the paid garrison
- executing, with great enthusiasm and zeal, many and various things

 <!-- for which he possessed royal orders and instructions, not  -->

He did not shrink from any kind of labor, or taking any care of himself. 

His first work was the walling of the city, to which he attended so assiduously, that it was almost completed before his death. [39] 

He also built a cavalier on the promontory of Manila where the old wooden fort, which he called Sanctiago, formerly stood, and fortified it with some artillery. 

He razed to the ground the fort of Nuestra Señora de Guia, which his predecessor had built.

He built of stone the cathedral of Manila, and encouraged the inhabitants of the city who had shortly before begun to build, to persevere in building their houses of stone, a work which the bishop was the first to begin in the building of his house. 

He:
- increased trade with China
- regulated better the navigation of Nueva España, and the despatch of vessels in that line
- built some galleys for the defense of the coast
- pacified the Zambales, who had revolted
- ordered his son Don Luys Dasmariñas, of the habit of Alcantara, to make an incursion with troops from Manila into the interior of the island of Luzon, [40] by crossing the river Ytui and other provinces not yet explored or seen by Spaniards, until he arrived at Cagayan. 

He built also an artillery foundry in Manila, where, for lack of expert founders, only a few large pieces were turned out.

In the first year of his administration, he sent the president and auditors of the suppressed Audiencia to España.

Licentiate Pedro de Rojas, the senior auditor, remained with the governor by order of his Majesty, as lieutenant-assessor in matters of justice, until some years later appointed alcalde in Mexico.

During Gomez Perez's administration, the relations and peace existing between the Japanese and the Spaniards of the Filipinas began to become strained. Hitherto, Japanese vessels had gone from the port of Nagasaki to Manila for some years, laden with their flour and other goods, where they had been kindly received, and despatched. 

But Taiko-sama, [41] lord of all Japan, was incited through the efforts of Farandaquiemon—a Japanese of low extraction, one of those who came to Manila—to write in a barbarous and arrogant manner to the governor, demanding submission and tribute, and threatening to come with a fleet and troops to lay waste the country. 

But, between demands and replies, several years were spent, until at last Taiko died. [42]

While Japan was causing the governor some anxiety, the king of Cambodia sent him an embassy by the Portuguese Diego Belloso, who brought a present of 2 elephants and offers of friendship and trade with his kingdom, and implored aid against Siam which was threatening Cambodia. 

The governor answered the king, and sent him a horse, with a few emeralds and other objects, but postponed until later what related to aid, and thanked him for his friendship.

This was the origin of the events and the expeditions made later from Manila to the kingdoms of Sian and Camboja, on the mainland of Asia.

From the moment that Gomez Perez received his charge in España, he had wanted to lead an expedition from Manila to conquer the fort of Terrenate in Maluco because of the previous failures.

<!-- , on account of the great importance of this enterprise, and its outcome, in which no success had been attained on other occasions.  -->

He was constantly making necessary arrangements for undertaking this expedition, but so secretly that he declared it to no one, until, in the year 1593, seeing that the preparations for his intention appeared sufficient, he declared his purpose, and made ready to

He set out in person, with more than 900 Spaniards and 200 sail, counting galleys, galliots, frigates, vireys, and other craft. 

He left the:
- war affairs of Manila and of the islands to Diego Ronquillo, his master-of-camp
- administration and justice to Licentiate Pedro de Rojas

<!-- , with a few troops, insufficient for the city's defense, in charge of  -->

He also sent his son, Don Luys Dasmariñas, forward with the rest of the fleet, as his lieutenant in the office of captain-general to Visayas while he himself remained in Manila making his final preparations and arming a galley of 28 benches, in which he was to sail. 

This galley he manned with good Chinese rowers, with pay. [43]

In order to win their goodwill, they were not chained, and even had certain weapons.

About 40 Spaniards embarked on the galley, and the galley itself was accompanied by a few frigates and smaller vessels, in which private individuals embarked.

The governor sailed from the port of Cabit, in October 1593, for the Visayas where they were to join the fleet which was awaiting them there, and to proceed to Maluco. 

In the afternoon of the second day of the voyage, they reached the island of Caça, [44] 24 leguas from Manila.

 <!-- and close to the coast of the same island of Luzon, at a place called Punta del Açufre [Sulphur Point], where there is a strong head wind.  -->

The galley tried to round this point by rowing, but being unable to make any headway until the wind should drop, they anchored and spread an awning, and stayed there that night. 

Some of the vessels sailing with the galley went in closer to the shore in sight of the galley, and awaited it there.

The governor and those who accompanied him passed the night playing on the poop, until the end of the first watch. 

<!-- After the governor had gone into his cabin to rest, the other Spaniards went also to their quarters [45] for the same purpose, leaving the usual guards in the midship gangway, and at the bow and stern.  -->
