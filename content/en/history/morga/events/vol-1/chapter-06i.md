While affairs in the Filipinas were in this condition, ships from Nueva España arrived at Manila in May 1598.

These ships brought despatches ordering the reëstablishment of the royal Audiencia, which had been suppressed in the Filipinas some years before.

Don Francisco Tello, who was governing the country, was named and appointed its president.

Its auditors were:
- Doctor Antonio de Morga
- Licentiates Christoval Telles Almaçan
- Alvaro Rodriguez Zambrano

The fiscal was Licentiate Geronymo de Salazar.

Other officials of the Audiencia were also appointed.

By the same ships arrived the archbishop, Fray Ignacio de Sanctivañes, who enjoyed the archbishopric only for a short time, for he died of dysentery in August.

The bishop of Sebu, Fray Pedro de Agurto came also. 

On May 8, 1598, the royal seal of the Audiencia was received.

It was taken from the monastery of San Agustin to the cathedral with great ceremony.

<!-- on a horse caparisoned with cloth of gold and crimson, and under a canopy of the same material.  -->

<!-- The staves of the canopy were carried by the regidors of the city, who were clad in robes of crimson velvet lined with white silver cloth, and in breeches and doublets of the same material. 

The horse that carried the seal in a box of cloth of gold covered with brocade was led on the right by him who held the office of alguacil-mayor, who was clad in cloth of gold and wore no cloak. Surrounding the horse walked the president and auditors, all afoot and bareheaded.

In front walked a throng of citizens clad in costly gala dress; behind followed the whole camp and the soldiers, with their drums and banners, and their arms in hand, and the captains and officers at their posts, with the master-of-camp preceding them, staff in hand. The streets and windows were richly adorned with quantities of tapestry and finery, and many triumphal arches, and there was music from flutes, trumpets, and other instruments. -->

<!-- When the seal was taken to the door of the cathedral of Manila, the archbishop in pontifical robes came out with the cross, accompanied by the chapter and clergy of the church to receive it. 

Having lifted the box containing the seal from the horse under the canopy, the archbishop placed it in the hands of the president. Then the auditors went into the church with him, while the band of singers intoned the Te Deum laudamus. They reached the main altar, upon the steps of which stood a stool covered with brocade. Upon this they placed the box with the seal.

All knelt and the archbishop chanted certain prayers to the Holy Spirit for the health and good government of the king, our sovereign. Then the president took the box with the seal, and with the same order and music with which it had been brought into the church it was carried out and replaced upon the horse. The archbishop and clergy remained at the door of the church, while the cortége proceeded to the royal buildings. 

The said box containing the royal seal was placed and left in a beautifully-adorned apartment, with a covering of cloth of gold and crimson, on a table covered with brocade and cushions of the same material, which stood under a canopy of crimson velvet embroidered with the royal arms.  -->

Then the royal order for the establishment of the Audiencia was publicly read there, and the nominations for president, auditors, and fiscal. 

Homage was done them and the usual oath administered. The president proceeded to the Audiencia hall, where the court rooms were well arranged and contained a canopy for the royal arms. There the president, auditors, and fiscal took their seats and received the ministers and officials of the Audiencia. 

Then the ordinances of the Audiencia were read in the presence of as many citizens as could find room in the hall. 

This completed the establishment of the Audiencia on that day. 

Thenceforth it has exercised its functions, and has had charge and disposition in all cases, both civil and criminal, of its district.

The latter includes the Filipinas Islands and all the mainland, of China discovered or to be discovered. In charge of the president who acts as governor of the land, were all government affairs according to royal laws, ordinances, and special orders, which were acted on and brought before the Audiencia.
