When Camboja was being ravaged by Sian, these 2 Malays went to Champ with many of their Malays and  Cambodians.

The Champa ruler did not show them all the honors that they desired. So they caused an insurrection in the city while he was away.

They plundered his city and returned to Cambodia with all the artillery and many captives. 

When they arrived here the usurper Anacaparan was ruling.

Congratulating one another mutually for their deeds, Anacaparan gave the Malays a friendly welcome.

The Malays gave Anacaparan all the artillery and other things they took from Champa.

Then Anacaparan gave them lands for their maintenance, and made them great mandarins.

These 2 Malays made it easy for him to capture Champa, and offered to seize the Champa king.

The Champa had been so great and long-standing an enemy of the Cambodians. Anacaparan agreed and immediately collected an army, which he sent under command of Ocuña de Chu.

When we killed Anacaparan, this army wass still in Chanpa. They returned after his death.

This army was now under the new king, Chupinanu, with all their Malays. They then attacked the insurgents of Tele.

At this juncture arrived the ambassador whom we met in Lao.

 <!-- as we reached Lanchan.  -->

He said that:
- the king of Lao was about to send the heir with great forces by river and by land
- the king of Cochinchina woudl send men by sea and join them in Camboja

<!--   was going to help us restore the heir.

we had remained there and that our purpose was to ask for the lawful heir of Camboja in order to take him to our ships and transport him to his kingdom;
 in this undertaking; that we had entered Lao with that report;

, where we would declare war and inflict severe punishment upon whomsoever would not render homage.  -->

When Chupinanu and his followers heard this news they were frightened.

<!--  and consequently each thought only of himself.

A few days later it was reported from the bar that four Spanish ships had entered, accompanied by many galleys from Cochinchina. This report was either a vision that some had seen, or was a fiction; and we have been unable to clarify the matter to this very day. At any rate, on hearing this news, these people confirmed as true the entire report of the ambassador who had fled.  -->

The mandarins of Camboja now had a war against the men of Tele and coming war with the Spaniards, Cochinchina, and Lao.

They decided to depose Chupinanu and render homage to the heir coming from Lao.

They kicked the 2 Malays out of the court where they retreated to friendly provinces in Camboja. 

<!-- For this purpose they communicated with the two Malays and together with them attacked the king with his brothers and turned them out of the realm. The two elder brothers fled separately, each to the province where he thought to find more friends.  -->

The mandarins ordered a fleet of row-boats, led by Ocuña de Chu as leader and his two sons, to go towards Lao to receive their king, who they said was already coming.

Other boats were sent to the bar to receive and make friends with the Spaniards.

<!-- , and make friendly terms with them, sending for that purpose certain Spaniards there. -->

Two Cambodian mandarins and the 2 Malays were to remain to guard the kingdom, and to act as governors. 

<!-- The Spaniards went to the bar, but, finding nothing, returned. -->

Ocuña de Chu took the road to Lanchan but suffered some pangs of hunger, for he had left the kingdom unprovided, and the way was long. 

<!-- Lao, but seeing that he did not meet his king, or hear any news of him, resolved to go to Lanchan and ask for him.

He continued his march, but  -->

<!-- On account of this some of his men deserted, but at last  -->

He reached Lanchan with 10 armed praus. 

<!-- Lao was thrown into great confusion imagining that he was coming to make war.

, they abandoned their villages and property, and fled to the mountains. But on seeing that he was coming on a peaceful mission, they lost their apprehension.  -->

When we arrived, we were already on the road to Cochinchina. Then the king ordered us to return to Lanchan immediately. 

The king of Lao learned what was happening in Camboja. He despatched there a large fleet by sea, and forces by land, and sent for the king of Camboja.

He despatched me to Cochinchina with news of what was happening, and to take the ships to Camboja.

But, while on the way, I heard of the battle fought by our fleet, whereupon I returned to Camboja with the king.

When we reached the first village of Camboja, we learned from the spies who had preceded us, that the Cambodian provinces were at war with each other because:
- Cuña de Chu was delaying so long
- The heir and the Spanish did not arrive


<!-- as the news of the ships had been untrue, and  was delaying so long, the provinces where the two brothers sought shelter had proclaimed them kings, and were at war with one another

The people of Tele had come to fight with the governors, who were divided into factions -->

<!-- ; and that each man obeyed whom he pleased.  -->

<!-- The sea and land forces were collected together at the point where this news had been received, and it was found that they were not sufficient to make a warlike entry. -->

Ocuña Lacasamana was one of the Malay headmen.
- He had the greatest force of artillery and praus.

A Japanese junk arrived, supporting Chupinannu.


We:
- built a fort
- requested for more men from Lao
- sent secret letters to probe the hearts of the leading men

The men from Lao delayed, and we received no answers to the letters. 

We felt insecure in that place and thought of returning to Lao.

Ocuña Lacasamana had fortified himself in his own land. But he said he would join the heir after he arrives. 

 <!-- saying that he was on their side, although he had rendered homage to Chupinanu—a feigned promise because he had seen the king's delay—but that as soon as the king entered the land he would join his party. -->


Another Cambojan governor said the same, but offered to kill Chupinanu after the heir arrived. 

When he heard the heir arrive, he received us. That province and many others were delivered to us immediately. 

<!--  to the effect that, although he had rendered homage to Chupinanu, yet, if the king would come to him, he would attack , and depose or kill him. 

For that he said that he had four thousand men fortified with himself on a hill. 

He sent one of his relatives with this message. All trusted in this man, and immediately we set out for that place. When the above-mentioned man learned of the king's approach, he attacked the other king and routed him; then he came out to  -->

Chupinanu withdrew to some mountains. 

Immediately the 2 Malays, each with his forces, joined us. The Japanese did the same.

The king then gave orders to pursue Chupinanu until he was taken and killed.

<!-- Then he seized another man who was acting as judge in another province and put him to death.  -->

Soon after war began against the eldest of the brothers and against the people of Tele who also refused homage. 

Then, a ship arrived from Malaca with 14 Spaniards of our fleet, who had put into Malaca.

The king was delighted at it. He honored them when he learned that some of them had killed the usurper.

<!-- They were esteemed and respected in an extraordinary manner by the whole kingdom.  -->

Captain Diego Belloso tried to assume charge of them through an old document from Malaca.

I forbade this, alleging that the right of this jurisdiction should come from Manila, since:
- the restoration of Camboja came from Manila. 
- those men were Castilians and had nothing to do with his document or with Malaca.

The king, before whom this matter was brought, replied that the matter lay between us two, and refused to mingle in those affairs.

Some of the newcomers coincided with Belloso's opinion, and others with mine.

 <!-- Thus we have gone on until now.  -->

This is why I did not ask the king for a fort to secure our personal safety. 

It would have been a footing for some business, [102] and what I shall relate later would not have happened to us.

After the arrival of the Castilians, the king sent an embassy to Cochinchina—a Spaniard and a Cambodian—to get father Fray Alonso Ximenez and certain Spaniards who had remained there.

The Chanpa ruler seized them, and they have not returned.

The wars continued, in all of which the Spaniards and Japanese took part.
