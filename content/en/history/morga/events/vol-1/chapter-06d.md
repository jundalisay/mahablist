<!-- Relation of the voyage of Adelantado Alvaro de Mendaña de Neira for the discovery of the Salomon Islands -->

On Friday, April 9, 1595, Adelantado Alvaro de Mendaña set sail with his fleet for the conquest and settlement of the western islands in the South Sea.

He sailed from the port of Callao de Lima, 12.5 degrees south latitude. 

Laying his course toward the valleys of Santa, Truxillo, and Saña, and collecting men, to increase his to 400 persons, and provisions, he went to Paita, is 5 degrees higher, on 4 ships. [67] 

<!-- There he took in water and numbered his forces, which amounted to about four hundred persons. -->

<!-- Then with his four vessels, two large and two small, he left the said port, which  than the former port, and directed his course  -->

From there, he sailed west-southwest to the altitude of 9.5 degrees in search of the islands that he had discovered. 
- Pedro Merino Manrique was his master-of-camp
- His brother-in-law, Lope de la Vega, was his admiral
- Pedro Fernandez de Quiros was chief pilot. 

Then he sailed southwest by west to 14 degrees, where he changed his course to northwest by west. 

On Friday, July 21 he reached an altitude of 10 long degrees, we sighted an island which the general named Madalena. [68] 

From its port, around 70 canoes came out, each containing 3 men. Some came swimming and others on logs. 

There were more than 400 natives, white and of a very agreeable appearance, tall and strong, large-limbed, and so well made that they by far surpassed us. [69] 

They had fine teeth, eyes, mouth, hands and feet, and beautiful long flowing hair, while many of them were very fair.

Very handsome youths were to be seen among them. All were naked and covered no part.

Their bodies, legs, arms, hands, and even some of their faces, were all marked after the fashion of these Bisayans.

For a barbarous people, naked, and of so little reason, one could not restrain himself, at sight of them, from thanking God for having created them.

<!-- And do not think this exaggeration, for it was so.  -->

These people invited us to their port. We in turn invited them to our flagship. Around 40 of them came aboard. 

In comparison with them we appeared to be men of less than ordinary size. 

Among them was one who was 1 palmo taller than the tallest man of our fleet, although we had in the fleet men of more than average height.

The general gave some of them shirts and other things, which they accepted with much pleasure, dancing after their fashion and calling others.

But being annoyed at the liberties that they took, for they were great thieves, the general had a cannon fired, in order to frighten them.

When they heard it they all swam ashore, seized their weapons, and at the sound of a conch threw a few stones at the ships and threatened us with their lances, for they had no other weapons. 

Our men fired their arquebuses at them from the ships and killed 5-6 of them, whereat they stopped.

Our fleet sailed on and we discovered 3 other islands.

This island has a circumference of about 6 leguas.

We passed it on its southern side. On that side it is high and slopes precipitously to the sea, and has mountainous ravines where the Indians dwell.

There seemed to be many inhabitants, for we saw them on the rocks and on the beach. 

We continued our course to the other three islands.

The first, to which was given the name San Pedro, is about ten leguas from Magdalena, and like it extends northwest by north.

It has a circumference of about three leguas. The island is beautiful, and rich in woods and fine fields. 

We did not ascertain whether it was inhabited or not, for we did not stop there. 

To the southeast and about 5 leguas from it lies another island to which the general gave the name of Dominica. 

It is very sightly, and to all appearances thickly populated, and has a circumference of about fifteen leguas.

To the south and a little more than one legua from it lies another island with a circumference of about eight leguas, which received the name of Sancta Cristina.

Our fleet passed through the channel that separates the one island from the other, for all that we saw of these islands is clear sailing. On the west side of Sancta Cristina, a good port was found, and there the fleet anchored. [70]

These natives did not resemble the first. But many beautiful women were seen. 

I did not see the latter, but some who did assured me that in their opinion, they are as beautiful as the women in Lima, but light complexioned and not so tall—and the women in Lima are very beautiful. 

The articles of food seen in that port were swine and fowl, sugar-cane, excellent bananas, cocoanuts, and a fruit that grows on high trees. 

Each of the last is as large as a good-sized pineapple, and is excellent eating. Much of it was eaten green, roasted, and boiled. 

When ripe it is indeed so sweet and good that, in my estimation, there is no other that surpasses it. 

Scarcely any of it, except a little husk, has to be thrown away. [71]

There was also another fruit with a flavor like that of chestnuts, but much larger in size than six chestnuts put together; much of this fruit was eaten roasted and boiled. Certain nuts with a very hard shell, and very oily, were also found, which were eaten in great quantities, and which, according to some, induced diarrhoea. We also saw some Castilian pumpkins growing. Near the beach there is a fine cascade of very clear water, which issues from a rock at the height of two men. Its volume is about the width of four or five fingers.

Then near by there is a stream, from which the boats drew a full supply of water. The Indians fled to the forests and rocks, where they fortified themselves and tried to do some mischief, by throwing stones and rolling down rocks, but they never wounded anyone, for the master-of-camp restrained them, by placing outposts.

The natives of this island saw one of our negroes. He made signs toward the south, saying that there were men like him there, and that they were wont to go there to fight; that the others were armed with arrows; and that they make the journey thither in certain large canoes which they possess. 

Since there was no interpreter, or much curiosity to learn more, no further investigations were made, although, 

I think it is impossible for natives to be so remote unless there is a chain of islands. This is because  their boats and their customs show that they have not come from afar.

This port lies in an altitude of nine and one-half degrees. 

The adelantado ordered three crosses to be planted, and on Saturday, August fifth, to weigh anchor and set sail southwest by west. 

We sailed with easterly and east southeasterly winds, now southwest by west and now northwest by west, for about four hundred leguas. One Sunday, August twenty, we sighted four low islands with sandy beaches, abounding in palms and other trees. On the southeast side, towards the north, was seen a great sandbank. 

All four islands have a circuit of about twelve leguas. Whether they were inhabited or not, we could not tell, for we did not go to them. That year appeared to be one of talk, of which I speak with anger. These islands lie in an altitude of ten and three-quarters degrees. They were named San Bernardo, [72] because they were discovered on that saint's day.

Thenceforward we began to meet southeasterly winds, which never failed us, and which seem to prevail in those regions. With these winds we continued to sail always in the said direction, never going above eleven or below ten degrees, until Tuesday, August 29, when we discovered a round islet, of about one legua in circumference, surrounded by reefs.

We tried to land there, so that the almiranta could take on wood and water, of which there was great need, but could find no landing-place. We gave it the name of La Solitaria [Solitary Island]. It lies in an altitude of ten and two-thirds degrees, and is about one thousand five hundred and thirty five leguas from Lima. [73] 

From this island we continued to sail in the said course: a thing which drew a variety of opinions from the men, some saying that we did not know where we were going, and other things which did not fail to cause some hard feelings; but by the mercy of God, at midnight on the eve of Nuestra Señora de Setiembre [Our Lady of September], we sighted an island of about ninety or one hundred leguas in circumference, which extends almost east southeast and west northwest, and lies about one thousand eight hundred leguas from Lima. [74] The whole island is full of dense forests, even to the highest ridges; and where it was not cleared for the Indians' fields, not a palmo of earth could be seen. The ships anchored in a port on the north side of the island, in ten degrees of latitude. 

About seven leguas north of that port, there is a volcano with a very well shaped cone, which ejects much fire from its summit, and from other parts. The volcano is high and about three leguas in circumference. On the side toward the sea it is very steep and quite bare, and offers no landing; and it rumbles frequently and loudly within. Northeast of this volcano are several small inhabited islets, surrounded by many shoals. The distance to these islets is seven or eight leguas. The shoals extend about northwest, and one who saw them said that they were numerous. Around the large island were several small ones, and as we sailed around them, we found that they were all inhabited, even the large one. Within sight of this large island, and to the southeast of it, we saw another island of no great size. This must be the connecting link with the other islands. [75] 

After having put into port at the great island Sancta Cruz, as it had been named, the adelantado ordered Captain Don Lorenzo, his brother-in-law, to go with the frigate in search of the almiranta, of which I have no favorable conjectures, and which had disappeared on the night that we sighted the island. It was sought on this and on two other occasions, but nothing except the shoals above-mentioned were found. What was seen in the way of food in this bay and port was swine, fowl, bananas, sugar-cane, some two or three kinds of roots resembling sweet potatoes, which are eaten boiled or roasted and made into biscuits, buyos [i.e., betel], two kinds of excellent almonds, two kinds of pine-nuts, ring-doves and turtle-doves, ducks, gray and white herons, swallows, a great quantity of amaranth, Castilian pumpkins, the fruit which I mentioned as being in the first islands, chestnuts, and walnuts. Sweet basil, of great fragrance, and red flowers, which are kept in the gardens at that port, and two other kinds of different flowers, also red, are found. There is another fruit which grows on high trees, and resembles the pippin in its pleasing smell and savor; a great quantity of ginger grows wild there, as also of the herb chiquilite, from which indigo is made. [76] 

There are agave-trees, abundance of sagia [sago (?)], [77] and many cocoanuts. Marble is also to be seen, as well as pearl shells and large snail-shells, like those brought from China. 

There is a very copious spring and five or six rivers of small volume. 

There we settled close by the spring. 

The Indians endeavored to prevent us; but as the arquebus tells at a distance, upon seeing its deadly effects, their hostility was lukewarm, and they even gave us some of the things that they possessed.

In this matter of procuring provisions, several cases of not over good treatment happened to the Indians; for the Indian who was our best friend and lord of that island, Malope by name, was killed, as well as two or three others, also friendly to us.

Only 3 leguas around the camp was explored.

The people of this island are black. 

They have small single-masted canoes for use about their villages; and some very large ones to use in the open sea.

On Sunday, October 8t, the adelantado had the master-of-camp stabbed. 

Tomas de Ampuero was also killed in the same way. 

Alférez Juan de Buitrago was beheaded. The adelantado intended to have two others, friends of the master-of-camp, killed, but was restrained therefrom at our request. 

<!-- The cause of this was notorious, for  -->

These men tried to convince the adelantado to leave the land and abandon it.

There must have been other reasons unknown to me; what I saw was much dissoluteness and shamelessness, and a great deal of improper conduct. 

On October 18, after a total eclipse of the moon on the 17th, the adelantado died. [78] 

November 2, Don Lorenzo, his brother-in-law, who had succeeded him as captain-general.

The priest Antonio de Serpa, seven or eight days before; and November eight the vicar, Juan de Espinosa.

Disease was rampant among our men and many died for lack of care, and the want of an apothecary and doctor.

The men begged the governor Doña Ysabel Barreto to take them out of the country.

All agreed to embark, and by the mercy of God, we left this port on Saturday, the eighteenth of the said month, and sailed southwest by west toward the island of San Cristoval or rather in search of it, to see whether we could find it or the almiranta, in accordance with the governor's orders. For two days nothing was seen; 

At the request of all the men, who cried out that we were taking them to destruction, she ordered me to steer from our settlement, located in ten and one-half degrees of latitude, to Manila. Thence I steered north northwest to avoid meeting islands on the way, since we were so ill prepared to approach any of them, with our men so sick that about fifty of them died in the course of the voyage and about forty there in the island. We continued our course short of provisions, navigating five degrees south and as many north, and meeting with many contrary winds and calms. When we reached an altitude of six long degrees north latitude, we sighted an island, apparently about twenty-five leguas in circumference, thickly wooded and inhabited by many people who resembled those of the Ladrones, and whom we saw coming toward us in canoes. From the southeast to the north and then to the southwest, it is surrounded by large reefs. [79] About four leguas west of it are some low islets. There, although we tried, we failed to find a suitable place to anchor; for the galliot and frigates which accompanied our ship had disappeared some days before. [80] From this place we continued the said course until we reached an altitude of thirteen and three-quarters degrees, and in the two days that we sailed west in this latitude, we sighted the islands of Serpana [i.e., Seypan] and Guan in the Ladrones. We passed between the two and did not anchor there, because we had no cable for lowering and hauling up the boat. This was the third of the month of January, one thousand five hundred and ninety-six. On the fourteenth of the same month we sighted the cape of Espiritu Sancto, and on the fifteenth we anchored in the bay of Cobos. [81] We reached there in such a state that only the goodness of God could have taken us thither; for human strength and resources would hardly have taken us a tenth of the way. We reached that place so dismantled and the crew so weak that we were a most piteous sight, and with only nine or ten jars of water. In this bay of Cobos the ship was repaired and the men recuperated as much as possible. On Tuesday, February second, we left the above port and bay, and on the tenth of the same month we anchored in the port of Cabite, etc.

Besides my desire to serve your Grace, I am moved to leave this brief relation for you, by the fact that if, perchance, God should dispose of my life, or other events should cause me or the relation that I carry to disappear, the truth may be learned from this one, which may prove a matter of great service to God and to the king our sovereign. [82] 

Will your Grace look favorably upon my great desire to serve you, of which I shall give a better proof, if God permit me to return to this port. Will your Grace also pardon my brevity, since the fault lies in the short time at my present disposal. 

Moreover, since no man knows what time may bring, I beg your Grace to keep the matter secret, for on considering it well, it seems only right that nothing be said about the first islands until his Majesty be informed and order what is convenient to his service, for, as the islands occupy a position midway between Peru, Nueva Españia, and this land, the English, on learning of them, might settle them and do much mischief in this sea. Your Grace, I consider myself as the faithful servant of your Grace. May God our Lord preserve you for many years in great joy and increasing prosperity, etc. 

Your Grace's servant, PEDRO FERNANDEZ DE QUIROS To Doctor Antonio de Morga, lieutenant-governor of his Majesty in the Filipinas.
