Through this news from Camboja, we learned of the good result attained by Diego Belloso and Blas Ruys. 

<!-- Don Luys Dasmariñas gaining encouragement in the enterprise that he had proposed, discussed it with greater warmth.  -->

It was thought difficult to raise the forces needed to establish the Camdbojan king Prauncar. 

So Don Luys offered to make this expedition at his own expense with those men who chose to follow him.

The theologians and jurists wanted to ask Camboja to help them conquer Champa as well.

<!--  were still raised as to the justification with which an entrance could be made into Camboja with armed forces for more than the protection of, and completion of establishing,  in his kingdom, and to leave preachers with him.

—it was said on Don Luys's behalf that after accomplishing the above, he would, with the necessary favor of the same king of Camboja, proceed to the neighboring kingdom of Champan and take possession of it for his Majesty. 

He would drive thence a usurper, the common enemy of all those kingdoms, who lorded over it, and who, from his fortress near the sea, sallied out against all navigators, plundering and capturing them.  -->


This was because the Champan usurper had committed many other crimes, murders, and thefts, on the Portuguese and other nations.

<!-- who were obliged to pass his coasts in their trading with, and voyages to, China, Macan, Xapon, and other kingdoms, concerning all of which sufficient testimony had been given. On account of all these reports, the theologians and jurists decided that the war against the ruler of Champan and the conquest of his lands was justifiable, and that this position was of no less importance to the Spaniards than that of Camboja. -->

The governor and president, Governor Don Francisco Tello, held a consultation with the Audiencia and others—religious and captains—on what to do. 

They agreed to Don Luys' plan. 

<!-- It was resolved that, since , the plan should be carried out. [105]  -->

<!-- Accordingly, an agreement was made with him on the above basis.  -->

He was to take the men at his own expense, with commission and papers from the governor for affairs of government and war, and provisions from the Audiencia for the administration of justice.

He began preparing ships, men, and provisions, in order to sail as soon as possible.

Governor Tello also despatched Don Joan de Çamudio with a moderate-sized ship to China to buy saltpeter and metals for the royal magazines of Manila.

 <!-- to obtain leave from the viceroy of Canton for the Spaniards to communicate and trade with his province.  -->

Don Joan reached Canton and was treated cordially by the viceroy.

<!-- his destination with good weather, and after stationing himself off the coast of Canton, sent certain of his company to the city with despatches for the tuton or viceroy.

When the viceroy heard of the arrival of the Spaniards and the reason thereof, he gave them audience, and  
 -->
The Portuguese residing in Macan near the city of Canton, made many efforts to prevent the viceroy from admitting the Spanish. 

<!-- , the conchifu, and other mandarins from admitting the Castilians of Manila into their country, alleging that the latter were pirates and evil-doers, who seized upon whatever kingdom and province they visited. 

They told them so many things that it would have sufficed to destroy them, had not the viceroy and mandarins looked at the matter dispassionately; for they knew the declaration of the Portuguese to be hate and enmity, and that these passions moved them to desire that the Castilians have no trade with China, for their own interests.  -->

<!-- The affair went so far, that, having been brought before a court of justice, silence was imposed upon the Portuguese of Macan, under penalty of severe corporal punishment; while  -->

The Castilians were assigned a port on the same coast, El Pinal [Pine Grove]. It was 12 leguas from the city of Canton.

They could always enter and make a settlement of their own.

They were given sufficient chapas [i.e., edicts or passports of safety] and provisions therefor. 

Thereupon Don Joan de Çamudio, entered El Pinal with his ship and there he was furnished with everything needful by the Chinese at a moderate price while the Spaniards went to and fro on the river upon their business to Canton in lorchas [106] and champans.

<!-- While the Spaniards were detained, in the said port they were always well received in the city and lodged in houses within its walls.

They went about the streets freely and armed, a thing which is new and unique in China in respect to foreigners.

This caused so great wonder and envy to the Portuguese (who are not so treated) that they tried with might and main to prevent it, even going so far as to come by night in boats from Macan to El Pinal to fire the ship of the Castilians.

This did not succeed, however, for, having been heard, the necessary resistance was made, and after that a good watch was always kept on board, until the ship having accomplished its business and object departed thence, much to the satisfaction of the Chinese, who gave the Spaniards chapas and documents for the future. -->

<!-- The ship returned to Manila at the start of 1599. -->



Don Luys Dasmariñas:
- equipped 2 moderate-sized ships and a galliot
- collected 200 unemployed men for this enterprise to Camboja
- supplied the necessary provisions, ammunition, and equipment on his ships
- was joined by:
  - Fray Alonso Ximenez and Fray Aduarte of the Order of St. Dominic
  - Fray Joan Bautista of the Order of St. Francis
  - some Japanese
  - natives of Manila

He left Manila in mid July 1598. 

<!-- [107] of the year ninety-eight. The weather was somewhat contrary as the seasons of the vendavals had set in, but his desire to accomplish his voyage, lose no time, and leave Manila, which was the greatest difficulty, caused him to disregard the weather; he thought that, once at sea, he would be able to stop on the coast in the port of Bolinao.

This plan did not succeed so well as Don Luis had anticipated, for,  -->

As soon as the fleet left the bay, it was so buffeted by the weather that it could not fetch the port of Bolinao or hold the sea. 

The flagship sprung a leak, and the ships returned to the mouth of the bay above Miraveles, [108] where they stayed several days refitting. 

When the weather moderated they set sail again, but again they were buffeted so violently that the ships were separated from one another, and the galliot—the weakest of them—with difficulty made the port of Cagayan.

Quite dismantled and very necessitous, it entered by the bar of Camalayuga to the city of Segovia, which is at the head of the island of Luzon opposite Great China. 

There the alcalde-mayor of that province furnished it the necessary provisions and tackle. 

Captain Luis Ortiz, who commanded this galliot, together with 25 Spaniards and some Indians, hastened preparations for their departure and again left that port to rejoin the fleet which he had to follow, according to his instructions, making for the bar of the river of Camboja which was their destination.

He had scarcely left Cagayan, when the almiranta entered the port in the same distress as the galliot. It was also detained some days to refit. Then it left again to rejoin the flagship and the galliot. 

The flagship being a stronger vessel kept the sea with difficulty.

The storm lasted a long time, it was compelled to run towards China near Macau.

<!-- The storm continued to rage so steadily that, without being able to meliorate its voyage, the ship was obliged to sail, amid high seas and cloudy weather, to certain small uninhabited islands on the coast of China below Macan.  -->

There it was many times in danger of shipwreck, and parts of the cargo were thrown away daily. 

The almiranta, after having been refitted, left Cagayan, made the same voyage in the same storm, and anchored near the flagship, where it was lost with some men and its entire cargo. [109]

The flagship did its best to rescue those who escaped from the almiranta, and although the former kept afloat several days, at length it grounded near the coast. 

There it began to leak so badly that, with that and the strong sea which struck it broadside, the vessel went to pieces. 

The ship's boat had already been lost. So they made rafts and prepare framework and planks on which Don Luis and the religious and crew—in all 120 Spaniards—went ashore.

They brought away from the said ship a few of the most valuable objects, the weapons, and the most manageable pieces of artillery, abandoning the rest as lost.

All of the Spaniards were so soaked and in so ill a plight that some Chinese who came to the coast, from some neighboring towns, both from compassion felt for their loss and on account of having been given certain things that had been brought away from the wreck, provided them with food and with a native vessel of small burden in which to leave that place and make for Macan and Canton, which were not far.

As soon as Don Luis and his men sighted Macan, the former sent two soldiers of his company in Chinese vessels to the city and settlement of the Portuguese to announce their arrival and hardships, in order to obtain some help from them.

He sent 2 other soldiers to Canton to ask the viceroy or tuton for assistance and protection, so that they might equip themselves in, and sail from, China, in prosecution of their voyage.

The people of Macan and their chief captain Don Pablo of Portugal received the Castilians so ill that they were thrown into prison and not allowed to return to Don Luis.

To the latter they sent word warning him to leave the coast immediately, as they would treat them all no less ill.

When the Portuguese learned that Captain Hernando de los Rios [110] and one of his companions had gone to Canton for the same purpose, they at once sent 2 Portuguese, members of their council and magistracy [camara and regimiento] to oppose their entry into China.

 <!-- by saying that they were robbers and pirates, and evil-doers, as they had said before of Don Joan de Çamudio, who at this time was with his ship in the port of El Pinal, as abovesaid. -->

<!-- In Canton, Captain Hernando de los Rios and his companion met Alferez Domingo de Artacho and other companions belonging to -->

The people from Don Joan's ship defended themselves against the calumnies and pretensions of the Portuguese.


<!-- who, on learning of the disaster of Don Luis's fleet and that it had been wrecked near by, came together and  -->


<!-- The result was that, as the main difficulty had been already overcome in the case of Don Joan, and the viceroy and mandarins were informed that all were from Manila, who Don Luis Dasmariñas was, and that he was going to Camboja with his fleet, they received him with the same good-will with which they had received Don Joan de Çamudio, and gave him permission to enter the port of E1 Pinal with him. -->

Don Joan de Çamudio met Don Luis and provided them with the things that they needed -- moderate-sized junk, on which he embarked with some of his men, and the artillery and goods which had been saved.

<!-- With Don Joan's assistance, Don Luis at once bought a strong,   -->

<!-- He enjoyed the same advantages in that port as the Spaniards of Don Joan de Çamudio's ship. 

He intended to remain there until, having sent news to Manila, ships and the other necessary things for pursuing his voyage thence to Camboja, should be sent him, in respect to which Don Luis would never allow himself to show any discouragement or loss of resolution. -->

Don Joan de Çamudio left El Pinal, leaving Don Luis Dasmariñas and his men in 1599. Hereached Manila in 12 days.

After him, Don Luis sent Alférez Francisco Rodrigues with 3 companions to Manila in a small champan to ask for a better ship. 


<!-- to beg the governor and his supporters for help and assistance in his present emergency, a vessel, and what was needful to continue the expedition that he had begun.  -->

<!-- In Manila, the news of Don Luis's loss and of the conditions to which he was reduced, was learned both from Don Joan de Çamudio and from Alférez Francisco Rodrigues, who reached Manila after the former.

Seeing that it was impossible for Don Luis to continue the voyage to Camboja, and that there was neither property nor substance with which to equip him again, nor the time for it,  -->

So a moderate-sized ship was purchased and despatched from Manila to E1 Pinal with provisions and other things, under Alférez Francisco Rodrigues.

<!-- , who was accompanied by some soldiers of whom he was captain and leader. -->
