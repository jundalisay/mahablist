All this, together with the persistence of the religious begging Taico to restore the merchandise to the Spaniards, angered him thoroughly.

Taicosama ordered to crucify them all and all the religious who preached the religion of Namban [86] in his kingdoms. 

Immediately seized were:
- 5 religious in the house at Miaco
- a religious from the galleon who had joined them
- all the Japanese preachers and teachers. [87] 

It was understood that the persecution would extend to the other orders and Christians in Japon, whereupon all received great fear and confusion.

But later Taico's wrath was moderated. He declared that only the following would be crucified:
- the religious in the house at Miaco and their companions
- the Japanese preachers and teachers who were arrested

All the others, together with the Spaniards of the ship, would be allowed to return to Manila. 

The governor of Nangasaqui, Fonzanbrandono, brother of Taracabadono, was ordered to do this.

He placed all those taken from the house of the Franciscan religious at Miaco on ox-carts, under a strong guard:
- Fray Pedro Baptista
- Fray Martin de Aguirre
- Fray Felipe de las Casas
- Fray Gonçalo
- Fray Francisco Blanco
- Fray Francisco de San Miguel
- 26 Japanese preachers and teachers 
- 2 boys who were in the service of the religious. 

Their right ears were cut off and were paraded through the streets of Miaco and through those of the cities of Fugimen, Usaca, and Sacai, [88] to the great grief and sorrow of all Christians who saw their sufferings.

The sentence and cause of their martyrdom was written on a tablet in Chinese characters, which was carried hanging on a spear:

{{< q >}}
Sentence of the Combaco, [89] lord of Xapon, against the discalced religious and their teachers, whom he has ordered to be martyred in Nangasaqui.

<!-- , from the island of Manila, in the capacity of -->
These men came from Luzon as ambassadors and were allowed to remain in the city of Miaco to preach the Christian religion which in former years I have strictly forbidden.

I order that they be executed together with the Japanese who embraced their religion. Therefore these 24 [sic] men will be crucified in the city of Nangasaqui. 

I again forbid the teaching of this religion henceforward. Should any person violate this order, he shall be punished together with his whole family. Given on the first of Echo, and second of the moon. [90]

These holy men were taken to Nangasaqui where the said religious set up a hospital called San Lazaro when they first came from the Filipinas.

There, on a hill sown with wheat, in sight of the town and port, and near a house and hospital, they were all crucified in a row.

 <!-- , established  by  on their , before going up to the capital,  -->

The religious were placed in the middle and the others on either side upon high crosses, with iron staples at their throats, hands, and feet, and with long, sharp iron lances thrust up from below and crosswise through their sides. [91]

Thus did they render their souls to their Creator for whom they died with great resolution, on the fifth of February, day of St. Agueda, of the year 1597.

<!-- They left behind in that ploughed field, and through it in all that kingdom, a great quantity of seed sown, which they watered with their blood, and from which we hope to gather abundant fruit of a numerous conversion to our holy Catholic faith.  -->

Before they were crucified, Fray Martin de Aguirre wrote a letter to Doctor Antonio de Morga in Manila.


To Doctor Morga, lieutenant-governor of Manila, whom may God protect, etc., Manila.

Farewell, Doctor! farewell! Our Lord, not regarding my sins, has, in His mercy, been pleased to make me one of a band of twenty-four [sic] servants of God, who are about to die for love of Him. Six of us are friars of St. Francis, and eighteen are native Japanese. With hopes that many more will follow in the same path, may your Grace receive the last farewell and the last embraces of all this company, for we all acknowledge the support which you have manifested toward the affairs of this conversion. And now, in taking leave, we beg of you—and I especially—to make the protection of this field of Christendom the object of your special care. Since you are a father, and look with favor upon all things which may concern the mission of the religious in this conversion, so may your Grace find one who will protect and intercede for you before God in time of need. Farewell sir! Will your Grace give my last adieu to Doña Juana. May our Lord preserve, etc. From the road to execution, January twenty-eight, one thousand five hundred and ninety-seven.

This king's greed has been much whetted by what he stole from the "San Felipe." It is said that next year he will go to Luzon, and that he does not go this year because of being busy with the Coreans. In order to gain his end, he intends to take the islands of Lequios [92] and Hermosa, throw forces from them into Cagayan, and thence to fall upon Manila, if God does not first put a stop to his advance. Your Graces will attend to what is fitting and necessary. [93]

FRAY MARTIN DE LA ASCENCION


The bodies of the martyrs, although watched for many days by the Japanese, were removed by bits (especially those of the monks) from the crosses as relics by the Christians of the place, who very reverently distributed them around. Together with the staples and the wood of the crosses they are now scattered throughout Christendom.

Two other religious of the same band, who were out of the house at the time of the arrest, did not suffer this martyrdom. 

One, called Fray Geronimo de Jesus, [94] hid himself and went inland, in order not to leave the country; the other, called Fray Agustin Rodriguez, was sheltered by the fathers of the Society, who sent him away by way of Macan.

General Don Mathia and the Spaniards of the ship, naked and stripped, left Japon. 

They embarked at Nangasaqui and went to Manila in various ships which make that voyage for the Japanese and Portuguese. 

The first news of this event we received in May 1597. 

Great grief and sadness was caused by the news, in the death of the holy religious, and in the disturbances which were expected to take place in future dealings between Japon and the Filipinas; as well as in the loss of the galleon and its cargo en route to Nueva España.

The value of the vessel was over 1 million [pesos?], and caused great poverty among the Spaniards.
