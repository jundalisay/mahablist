The islands of the eastern Ocean Sea, adjacent to farther Asia and belonging to the crown of España are called "the Western Islands" by those who go there via America. 

<!--  navigate thither by way of the demarcation of Castilla and Castilla's seas and lands of America, 

 for from the time that one leaves España, he sails in the course of the sun from east to west, until he reaches them.  -->

They are called "Eastern Islands" by those who sail from west to east by way of Portuguese India.

<!-- each of them circumscribing the world by voyaging in opposite directions, until they meet at these islands, which are numerous and of varying size;  -->

They are called Filipinas, and are subject to the crown of Castilla. 

They lie within the tropic of Cancer, and extend from 24 degrees north latitude to the equinoctial line, which cuts the islands of Maluco.

There are many others on the other side of the line, in the tropic of Capricorn, which extend for 12 degrees in south latitude. [211] 

The ancients affirmed that each and all of them were desert and uninhabitable. [212]

But now experience has shown that they were wrong. 

That place has:
- good climates
- many people
- food and other things necessary for human life 
- many mines of rich metals
- precious gems and pearls
- animals and plants which nature has not stinted.

It is impossible to number all the islands—counting larger and smaller—of this vast archipelago.

Those under the government of Filipinas are about 40 large islands, besides other smaller ones, all consecutive. 

The chiefest and best known are Luzon, Mindoro, Tendaya, [213] Capul, Burias, Mazbate, Marinduque, Leite, Camar, Ybabao, Sebu, Panay, Bohol, Catenduanes, Calamianes, Mindanao, and others of less renown.

The first island conquered and colonized by the Spaniards was Cebu. [214] 

From there the conquest was started and continued in all the neighboring islands.

Those islands are called Viçayas or Pintados because the more prominent of the men, from their youth, tattoo their whole bodies.

They prick them and then throw certain black powders over the bleeding surface. The shapes becoming indelible.

Luzon is the largest island and nearest and opposite to Great China and Japon.

The chief seat of the government, and the principal Spanish settlement, was moved to Luzon.
