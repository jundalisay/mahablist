The Spaniards living in the islands are divided into 5 classes of people:

1. Prelates, religious, and ecclesiastical ministers, both secular and regular
2. Encomenderos, settlers, conquerors
3. Soldiers, officers, and officials of war (both on land and sea), and those for navigation
4. Merchants, business men, and traders;
5. His Majesty's agents for government, justice, and administration of his royal revenue.

The ecclesiastical prelates are:

- The archbishop of Manila

He:
- resides in the city in charge of his cathedral church
- has a salary of 4,000 pesos [391] paid from the royal treasury annually. 

Also paid from the treasury are the salaries to:
- the holders of the dignidades [392] 
- canonries
- other prebends
- those performing other services

They are all:
- under royal patronage
- provided in accordance with the king's orders. 

The archbishop's office and jurisdiction consists of and extends to all, both the spiritual and temporal, that is ecclesiastic, and to its management. [393]


The bishops of the following cities are suffragans of the archbishop of Manila:
- the city of Santisimo Nombre de Jesus in Sibu
- Segovia in Cagayan
- Caceres in Camarines

They have the same rights of jurisdiction and enjoy the same privileges in their dioceses.

Any appeal from their judgments is made to the archbishop of Manila.
- He summons and convokes them to his provincial councils whenever necessary. 

They receive each an annual salary of 500,000 maravedis for their support from the royal treasury of Manila, besides their offerings and pontifical dues. 

All together it is quite sufficient for their support, according to the convenience of things and the cheapness of the country.

At present the bishops do not possess churches with prebendaries nor is any money set aside for that. [394]

The regular prelates are the provincials of the four mendicant orders, namely, St. Dominic, St. Augustine, St. Francis, the Society of Jesus, and the discalced Augustinians. [395] 

Each prelate governs his own order and visits the houses.

The orders have nearly all the missions to the natives under their charge, in whatever pertains to the administration of the sacraments and conversion—by favor of, and in accordance with, their privileges and the apostolic bulls, in which until now they have maintained themselves—and in what pertains to judicial matters, as vicars of the bishops, and through appointment and authorization of the latter. 

The discalced Augustinians as yet have no missions, as they have but recently entered the islands.

The monasteries are supported by certain special incomes that they possess and have acquired—especially those of the Augustinians and those of the Society—and by help and concessions granted by his Majesty.

The Dominicans and Franciscans do not possess or allow incomes or properties; [396] and for them, as for the other orders, the principal source of revenue is in the alms, offerings, and aid given by the districts where they are established and where they have charge.

This help is given by both Spaniards and natives, very piously and generously. They are aided also by the stipend given them from the encomiendas for the instruction that they give there. 

Consequently the religious of the orders live well and with the comfort necessary.


The first encomenderos, conquerors, and settlers of the islands, and their issue, are honorably supported by the products of their encomiendas, and by certain means of gain and trading interests that they possess, as do the rest of the people.

There are a great number of them, each one of whom lives and possesses his house in the city and settlement of Spaniards in whose province he has his encomienda. This they do in order not to abandon their encomiendas, and thus they are nearer the latter for their needs and for collections.

Now but few of the first conquerors who gained the country and went there for its conquest with the adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legaspi remain alive.

The soldiers and officers of war and of naval expeditions formerly consisted of all the dwellers and inhabitants of the islands, who rendered military service without any pay or salary.

They went on all the expeditions and pacifications that arose, and guarded the forts and presidios, and cities and settlements.

This was their principal exercise and occupation.

They were rewarded by the governor, who provided them with encomiendas, offices, and profits of the country according to their merits and services. [397]

At that time, the soldiers of the islands were the best in the Indias.

They were very skilful and well-disciplined by both land and sea, and were esteemed and respected by all those nations.

They gloried in their arms, and in acquitting themselves valiantly.

Afterwards, Gomez Perez Das Mariñas founded the regular camp of 400 soldiers when he led the government of the Filipinas.

Rank | Pay
--- | ---
Arquebusiers | 6 pesos per month
Musketeers | 8 pesos
6 Captains | 420 pesos each annually
1 master-of-camp | 1,400 pesos
1 sargento-mayor | captain's pay
1 adjutant of the sargento-mayor and field-captain | 10 pesos monthly 
2 castellans | 400 pesos annually eaach
Commandants of the 2 fortresses of Manila | 400 pesos annually eaach
1 general of galleys | 800 pesos annually
1 galley captain | 300 pesos annually


The Captains had alféreces, sergeants, corporals, standard-bearers, and drummers, with pay in proportion to their duties. 

The commandants had their lieutenants squads of soldiers and artillerymen.

The galley captains had their boatswains, boatswains' mates, coxswains, alguacils of the galleys, soldiers, artillerymen, master-carpenters, riggers, sailors, conscripts, [398] galley-crews of Spanish, Sangley, and native convicts, condemned for crimes.

When there is lack of convicts, good rowers are obtained from the natives for pay, for the period of the expedition and the occasion of the voyage. [399]

In the vessels and fleets of large vessels for the Nueva España line, the ships that are sent carry a general, admiral, masters, boatswains, commissaries, stewards, alguacils, sergeants of marine artillery [condestables], artillerymen, sailors, pilots and their assistants, common seamen, carpenters, calkers, and coopers, all in his Majesty's pay, on the account of Nueva España, from whose royal treasury they are paid. 

All that is necessary for this navigation is supplied there.

Their provisions and appointments are made by the viceroy; and this has hitherto pertained to him, even though the ships may have been constructed in the Filipinas.

They sail thence with their cargo of merchandise for Nueva España, and return thence to the Filipinas with the reënforcements of soldiers and supplies, and whatever else is necessary for the camp, besides passengers and religious, and the money proceeding from the investments and merchandise. [400]

After the establishment of a regular camp for guard and expeditions, the other inhabitants, dwellers, and residents were enrolled without pay under the banners of six captains of the Filipinas, for special occasions requiring the defense of the city.

But they were relieved of all other duties pertaining to the troops, unless they should offer of their own accord to go upon any expedition, or volunteer for any special occasion, in order to acquire merits and benefits, so that they may be given encomiendas that become vacant, and offices, and the means of profit of the country.

They are not compelled or obliged to do this, unless they are encomenderos. Consequently all have given themselves to trading, as there is no other occupation, but they are not unmindful of military service.

His Majesty prohibits all who are in his pay in the military forces of the islands from engaging in commerce; and orders the governor not to allow this, or permit them to export goods to Nueva España. If the governors would observe that order, it would not be amiss. [401]
