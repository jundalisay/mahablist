This island of Luzon extends lengthwise, from the point and head where one enters the Filipinas Islands (by the channel of Capul, which lies in 13.5 degrees north latitude) to the other point in the province of Cagayan, called Cape Bojeador (and located opposite China, in twenty degrees), more than 200 leguas. 

In some parts its width is more constricted than in others, especially in the middle of the island, where it is so narrow that it is less than thirty leguas from sea to sea, or from one coast to the other. The whole island is more than four hundred leguas in circumference.

The climates of this island are not harmonious.

They present a great diversity in its different districts and provinces. The head and beginning of the island, in the region of the channel, is more temperate in the interior, although the coasts are hot. 

The site of the city of Manila is hot, for it is on the coast and is low. 

But in its vicinity, quite near the city, there are districts and settlements much cooler, where the heat is not oppressive. 

The same is true of the other head of the island, opposite China, named Cagayan. 

The seasons of the year—winter and summer—are contrary to those in Europe; for the rains generally last in all these islands from the month of June until the month of September, and are accompanied by heavy showers, whirlwinds, and storms on sea and land. The summer lasts from October to the end of May, with clear skies and fair winds at sea. 

However, the winter and rainy season begins earlier in some provinces than in others. [215] In Cagayan winter and summer almost coincide with those of España, and come at the same seasons.

The people inhabiting the province of Camarines and almost as far as the provinces of Manila, in this great island of Luzon, both along the coast and in the interior, are natives of this island. 

They are of medium height, with a complexion like stewed quinces; and both men and women are well-featured. They have very black hair, and thin beards; and are very clever at anything that they undertake, keen and passionate, and of great resolution.

All live from their labor and gains in the field, their fishing, and trade, going from island to island by sea, and from province to province by land.

The natives of the other provinces of this island as far as Cagayan are of the same nature and disposition, except that it has been learned by tradition that those of Manila and its vicinity were not natives of this island, but came thither in the past and colonized it; and that they are Malay natives, and come from other islands and remote provinces. [216]

In various parts of this island of Luzon are found a number of natives black in color. Both men and women have woolly hair, and their stature is not very great, although they are strong and robust. These people are barbarians, and have but little capacity.

They possess no fixed houses or settlements, but wander in bands and hordes through the mountains and rough country, changing from one site to another according to the season.

They support themselves in certain clearings, and by planting rice, which they do temporarily, and by means of the game that they bring down with their bows, in the use of which they are very skilful and certain. [217] 

They live also on honey from the mountains, and roots produced by the ground. They are a barbarous people, in whom one cannot place confidence. 

They are much given to killing and to attacking the settlements of the other natives, in which they commit many depredations; and there is nothing that can be done to stop them, or to subdue or pacify them, although this is always attempted by fair or foul means, as opportunity and necessity demand.

The province of Cagayan is inhabited by natives of the same complexion as the others of the island, although they are better built, and more valiant and warlike than the others. They wear their hair long and hanging down the back. 

They have been in revolt and rebellion twice since the first time when they were pacified; and there has been plenty to do, on different occasions, in subduing them and repacifying them.

The apparel and clothing of these natives of Luzon before the entrance of the Spaniards into the country were generally, for the men, certain short collarless garments of cangan, sewed together in the front, and with short sleeves, and reaching slightly below the waist; some were blue and others black, while the chiefs had some red ones, called chinanas. [218] 

They also wore a strip of colored cloth wrapped about the waist, and passed between the legs, so that it covered the privy parts, reaching half-way down the thigh; these are called bahaques. [219] They go with legs bare, feet unshod, and the head uncovered, wrapping a narrow cloth, called potong [220] just below it, with which they bind the forehead and temples. 

Around their necks they wear gold necklaces, wrought like spun wax, [221] and with links in our fashion, some larger than others.

On their arms they wear armlets of wrought gold, which they call calombigas. These are very large and made in different patterns. 

Some wear strings of precious stones—cornelians and agates; and other blue and white stones, which they esteem highly. [222] 

They wear around the legs some strings of these stones, and certain cords, covered with black pitch in many foldings, as garters. [223]

In a province called Zambales, they wear the head shaved from the middle forward. 

On the skull they have a huge lock of loose hair. [224] 

The women throughout this island wear small jackets [sayuelos] with sleeves of the same kinds of cloth and of all colors, called varos. [225] 

They wear no shirts, but certain white cotton garments which are wrapped about the waist and fall to the feet, while other dyed cloths are wrapped about the body, like kirtles, and are very graceful. 

The principal women have crimson ones, and some of silk, while others are woven with gold, and adorned with fringe and other ornaments. 

They wear many:
- gold necklaces around the neck
- calumbigas on the wrists
- large earrings of wrought gold in the ears
- rings of gold and precious stones. 

Their black hair is done up in a very graceful knot on the head. 

Since the Spaniards came to the country many natives do not wear bahaques, but wide drawers of the same cloths and materials, and hats on their heads.

The chiefs wear braids of wrought gold containing many designs, while many of them wear shoes.

The chief women also wear beautiful shoes, many of them having shoes of velvet adorned with gold, and white garments like petticoats.

Men and women, and especially the chief people, are very clean and neat in their persons and clothing, and of pleasing address and grace.

They dress their hair carefully, and regard it as being more ornamental when it is very black.

They wash it with water in which has been boiled the bark of a tree called gogo. [226] 

They anoint it with aljonjoli oil, prepared with musk, and other perfumes.

All are very careful of their teeth, which from a very early age they file and render even, with stones and iron. [227] 

They dye them a black color, which is lasting, and which preserves their teeth until they are very old, although it is ugly to look at. [228]

They quite generally bathe the entire body in the rivers and creeks, both young and old, without thinking that it could at any time be injurious to them; [229] for in their baths do they find their best medicines.

When an infant is born, they immediately bathe the baby and the mother.

The women have needlework as their employment and occupation. They are very clever at it, and at all kinds of sewing. 

They weave cloth and spin cotton, and serve in the houses of their husbands and fathers. They pound the rice for eating, [230] and prepare the other food.

They raise fowls and swine, and keep the houses, while the men are engaged in the labors of the field, and in their fishing, navigation, and trading. 

They are not very chaste, either single or married women. Their husbands, fathers, or brothers are not very jealous or anxious about it. 

Both men and women are so selfish and greedy that, if they are paid, they are easily won over.

When the husband finds his wife in adultery, he is smoothed and pacified without any trouble.

After knowing the Spaniards, the more enlightened among them have sometimes killed the adulterers.

Both men and women, especially the chiefs, walk slowly and sedately when:
- on their visits
- going through the streets and to the temples

They are accompanied by many slaves, both male and female, with silk parasols to protect them from the sun and rain.

The women walk ahead and their female servants and slaves follow them. Behind these walk their husbands, fathers, or brothers, with their man-servants and slaves. [231]
