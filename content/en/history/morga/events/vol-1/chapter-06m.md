They have bestowed upon Captain Diego Belloso and myself the title of grandee, the highest in their kingdom, so that we may be more respected and feared, and better obeyed.


<!-- Two of the best provinces in the kingdom are entered in our names, and will be made over to us as soon as the turmoils of war are settled and assemblies have been held to take the oaths to the king, which has not yet been done.  -->

<!-- In the meantime we are making use of other people whom the king orders to be given us. There is no opportunity in the kingdom for any one else to possess entire power and command, beyond
 whom the king favors on account of his -->

Only Ocuña Lacasamana, leader of the Malays, has the large forces to gain Cambodia. 

<!-- , and because he needs him for the wars in which he is engaged. -->

The Spaniards have some encounters with his men, for which reason we hold aloof from one another.

I have informed your Grace of these wars so that you may judge whether his Majesty has any justifiable and legal right to seize this kingdom since your forces killed its usurper. 

<!-- the man who was quietly in possession of it; and since its heir, who was driven away where he had lost hope of ever again possessing it, has afterward reconquered it through his Majesty's subjects, who have guarded and defended his person from his enemies.  -->

The Cambojan king will never give it up voluntarily.

 <!-- will never be realized, as he rather fears having so many Spaniards in his country, even while he esteems them;  -->

He dreads that the Spanish will deprive him of his kingdom. His keeping his kingdom only requires his  determination. Some of our enemies impress this fact on him, especially the Moros. 

I beg your Grace to see that we do not lose our hold on Camboja, since so much has been accomplished in it, and it has been brought to a so satisfactory state.

Moreover it is very important to possess a fortress on the mainland, since it is the beginning of great things. 

For if a fortress be built here, and the king see a large force in this land, he would have to do what he knows to be just, even if ill-disposed.

This is because Camboja is really ruled by the king's mother, aunt, and grandmother.

<!-- , who rule and govern, for he only does as they tell him. -->

He is a child and is addicted to wine more than his father.

He only thinks of sports and hunting, and cares nothing for the kingdom.

If he sees more Spaniards, he would do whatever they wished because he loves them; neither would our opponents dare to offer any opposition.

If there are few men in the Filipinas are available, at least send as many as possible with the friars, so as not to lose this jurisdiction and our share in anything.

Diego Belloso asked Malaca for religious, men, and documents, so that he can become chief justice of Camboja and rule over them through Malaca.

Since Camboja has been restored by Manila, your Grace should not allow others to reap the fruits of our labors.

If you send soldiers and the Cambodians refuse to maintain them because of their small number, I will maintain them. 

<!--  do here whatever your Grace bade me, so long as it were reasonable; 

 until more soldiers came, I could manage to make the Cambodians give it, however much against their inclination.  -->

These soldiers should come bound hard and fast by documents.
- This is because the country is very vast.

They should be disciplined because the lack of discipline caused our encounter with the Lao.

It has been very difficult for me to despatch this vessel, because:
- the Cambojan king receives very little for any purpose
- many opponents prevent it

The mandarins, whether native or foreign, are not pleased to foreigners.

  <!-- see men set over them in the kingdom—and as I am poor, for I have lived hitherto by war, and subsisted from its gains by many wars, for the king also is very poor. -->

The Spaniard whom I entrust with this mission is poor and an excellent soldier.

<!-- ; and to enable him to go, I have assisted him from my indigence.  -->

<!-- Will your Grace please assist both him and the Cambodian, in order that the latter may become acquainted with some of the grandeur of his Majesty. I would rejoice to be the bearer of this, so as to give your Grace a long account of these affairs and of other notable things, and of the fertility of these kingdoms; but neither the king nor his mothers have allowed me to go, as the bearer will state, among other things.  -->

Your Grace may believe him, for he is a person disinterested in all respects, having just arrived from Macan.

On account of the many wars, the king does not have many things to send your Grace. 

He sends 2 ivory tusks, and a slave.

<!-- Your Grace will forgive him; he will send many things next year, if the pacification of his country is accomplished, for he still has something to do in it.  -->

I have persuaded him to send troops from Manila in order to complete the pacification of Camboja.

But his mothers do not want it. 

<!-- would not have it on any account, I am sure that they act thus in order not to promise them lands for their maintenance, or that they may not seize the land. But when they were in Lao, they promised very vast lands. But if what is done is not sufficient to provide for them, let the mercy of God suffice. 

When this embassy was despatched, Diego Belloso and myself told the king that if he did not give us the lands that he had promised us, we intended to go to Luzon, because we did not now possess the wherewithal with which to maintain ourselves. Many things occurred with respect to this request, but finally he gave us the lands, as is stated in the embassy; he gave them to us on condition of our holding them in his service and obedience. By this means I shall have more resources for your Grace's service.  -->

I spent all my possessions in meeting the expenses that I incurred in that city [i.e., Manila], and in maintaining my men in this kingdom. 

<!-- For that purpose I took the silver of the common seamen of my vessel, and although I paid the latter with some silver which we found in the [Chinese] ships, Gallinato would not consent to it, but took it all for himself.

In Malaca they made me pay it out of the property on my ship, and would not consent to their being paid out of the prizes, since the war was considered a just one. [104] For this reason I am now destitute of any property, and therefore do not possess the means of serving your Grace as I ought and as I should have desired. 

Recollecting your Grace's unique armory I send you a bottle and a small flask of ivory. Your Grace will forgive the trifle for I promise to compensate for it next year. Your Grace may command me in any service for I shall take great pleasure therein.  -->

Will your Grace do me the favor to protect my affairs, so that they may gain some merit by your favor. Trusting to this, may our Lord preserve your Grace, and give you increase in your dignity, as this servant of your Grace desires in your affairs.

From Camboja, July 20, 1598.

Your Grace's servant,

BLAS RUYZ DE HERNAN GONÇALES
