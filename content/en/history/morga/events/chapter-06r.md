<!-- When the affairs of Japon were discussed above, we spoke of the loss of the ship "San Felipe" in Hurando, in the province of Toca;

 of the martyrdom of the discalced Franciscan religious in Nangasaqui; and of the departure of the Spaniards and religious who had remained there, with the exception of Fray Geronymo de Jesus, who, changing his habit, concealed himself in the interior of the country. -->

<!-- After  had replied to the governor of Manila, through his ambassador, Don Luis Navarrete, excusing himself for what had happened, 

At the instigation of  -->

Faranda Quiemon and his supporters incited Taicosama to send a fleet against Manila.

<!-- that he had supplied Faranda with rice and other provisions in order to despatch it; and that the latter had begun preparations, but not having managed to bring the matter to the point that he had promised, the enterprise was dragged on and left in that condition.  -->

Taicosama was afterwards seized with a severe sickness in Miaco and died.

 <!-- not without having first had time to dispose of the succession and government of his kingdom, and to see that the empire should be continued in  -->

His only son was only 10 years old at that time. 

So he assigned Yeyasudono, the greatest tono in Japon lord of Kanto in the north.

<!-- —who had children and grandchildren, and more influence and power in Japon than any other man in the kingdom.  -->

<!-- Taicosama summoned Yeyasudono to court, and told him that he wished to marry his son to the latter's granddaughter, the daughter of his eldest son, so that he might succeed to the empire. The marriage was celebrated, and the government of Japon left, until his son was older, to Yeyasudono, associated with Guenifuin, Fungen, Ximonojo, and Xicoraju, his special favorites and counselors, [125] to whose hands the affairs of his government had passed for some years, in order that thus united they might continue to administer them after his death, until his son, whom he left named and accepted by the kingdom as his successor and supreme lord of Japon, was old enough to rule in person. -->

After the death of Taicosama in 1599, [126] the 5 governors kept his son carefully watched in the fortress of Osaka while they remained at Miaco at the head of the government.

Consequently the pretensions of Faranda Quiemon to make an expedition against Manila ceased altogether.

Since the affairs of Japon are never settled, but have always been in a disturbed condition, they could not last many days as Taico left them.

The new administration allowed the tonos, lords, captains to return to court. 
- Previously, these were busy in the wars with Korea and China, preventing them from destabilizing local affairs. 
- The men returned and became restless and corrupt.

 <!-- and the arrival at court, from other provinces of Japon, of , and soldiers, whom the combaco in his lifetime had kept busy  the king of China, in order to divert them from the affairs of his kingdom, the men began to become . -->

The 4 governors feared that Yeyasudono would seize the empire for himself, and exclude Taico's son, who had been married to his granddaughter. 

Many tonos and lords wanted disorder so that each one could act for his own interest.

<!-- of the kingdom felt the same way about the matter; and now, either because they desired the succession of Taico's son, or because they liked to see matters in -->

Taicosama was a tyrant, feared rather than loved. They persuaded the governors to oppose Yeyasudono and check his designs.

<!-- Under this excitement, the opposition became so lively, that they completely declared themselves, and  -->

Yeyasudono had to leave Miaco and return to his lands of Kanto.

<!-- in order to insure his own safety and return to the capital with large forces with which to demand obedience.  -->

The governors put 200,000 soldiers in the field.

They were joined by most of the tonos and lords of Japon, [127] both Christian and pagan.

They fought with 100,000 men from Kanto. 

<!--  were hurriedly met by

 while the minority remained among the partisans and followers of Yeyasudono. 

The latter came down as speedily as possible from Kanto to meet the governors and their army, in order to give them battle with one hundred thousand picked men of his own land. The two armies met, and the battle was fought with all their forces. [128] -->

<!-- In the course of the struggle, there were various fortunes, which rendered the result doubtful. -->

Finally, a number of men had deserted the governors to that of Yeyasudono, who won in the end. 

<!-- it was perceived that the latter's affairs were improving. Victory was declared in his favor, after the death of many soldiers and lords. -->

The 4 governors, surrendered to Yeyasudono. 

After he had beheaded the majority of the tonos, and deprived others of their seigniories and provinces, which he granted again to men devoted to his party.

 <!-- and after his return to the capital, triumphant over his enemies, and master of the whole kingdom: -->

He crucified the governors immediately, and cut their ears off. Then they were carried through the streets of the principal cities of Usaca, Sacay, Fugimen, and Miaco, in carts until they died on the crosses in the midst of other tortures. 

<!-- Since these were the men through whose zeal and advice Taico had, a few years before, inflicted the same punishment upon the discalced friars whom he martyred, we may infer that God chose to punish them in this world also with the same rigor.

Thus Yeyasudono remained the supreme ruler of Japon as Taico had been, but failed to withdraw the son from the fortress of Usaca; on the contrary he set more guards over him. -->

He changed his name to Daifusama for the sake of greater dignity.

Fray Geronymo de Jesus, associate of the martyrs, stayed hidden in Japon because of Taicosama's persecution.

 <!-- lived in disguise in the interior of the country among the Christians.  -->

<!-- Consequently, although he was carefully sought, he could not be found, until, after Taicosama's death and Daifu's seizure of the government, he came to Miaco.  -->

He revealed himself to one of Dayfu's servants. 

He told the servant of many things about:
- the Filipinas
- the king of España
- Spain's kingdoms and seigniories, especially those of Nueva España and Peru, of which the Filipinas were a dependency and with whom they had communication
- the importance to Daifu of gaining the friendship and commerce of the Spaniards. 

The servant related all these things to Daifu who wanted to have the trade and commerce, which the Portuguese had established in Nangasaqui, to be established in Kanto. 

So he summoned Fray Geronymo.

Fray Geronymo told him about:


<!-- that after the martyrdom of his associates, he had remained in Japon, that he was one of the religious whom the governor of Manila had sent when Taicosama was alive, to treat of peace and friendship with the Spaniards, and who had died as was well known, after having made converts to Christianity and established several hospitals and houses at the capital and other cities of Japon, where they healed the sick and performed other works of piety, without asking any other reward or advantage than to serve God, to teach the souls of that kingdom the faith and path of salvation, and to serve their neighbors.

In this work, and in works of charity, especially to the poor, as he and his fellow religious professed, they lived and maintained themselves, without seeking or holding any goods or property upon the earth, solely upon the alms which were given them therefor.  -->

- the king of España
- Spanish territories which included Nueva España, Piru, Filipinas, and India,
- conservation of the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the true God

<!-- , that he was a Christian, and that he possessed great kingdoms and territories in all parts of the world; and that  belonged to him; and that he governed and defended them all, attending above all else to the growth and 

, and Creator of the universe. -->

<!-- The religious explained to the king, as well as he could, other things concerning the Christian religion, and said that if he wished friendship with his Majesty and the latter's subjects of Manila, as well as with his viceroys of Nueva España and Piru he [i.e., Fray Geronymo] would be able to compass it, for it would be very useful and profitable to the king and to all his Japanese kingdoms and provinces. This last motive, namely, the profit and benefit to be derived from  with the Spaniards, was more to the taste of  -->

Daifusama was more interested in profit and benefit from friendship and commerce than religion. 

 <!-- what he had heard concerning their religion.  -->

<!-- Although he did not reject the latter or say anything about it, yet at this interview and at others with Fray Geronymo—whom Daifu had given permission to appear in public in his religious habit, and to whom he furnished the necessary support—he treated -->

He asked only of:
- friendship with the governor of Manila
- the Spaniards' coming yearly with ships from Manila to trade at Kanto port
- an established commerce with the Spaniards

His Japanese were to sail thence to Nueva España, where they were to enjoy the same amity and trade.

Daifu said that Japan had silver mines which were unexplored because no one knew how.

Daifu proposed that:
- the governor of Manila send him masters and workmen to build ships.
- some Spanish should establish their house and dwelling to mine silver, just as the religious of the Society of Jesus had theirs with the Portuguese in Nangasaqui. 

<!-- 
He also proposed that in the said kingdom and principal port of Quanto, which, as above-said, lies in the north of Japon, and is a mountainous country, abounding in silver mines, which were not worked because 

, Fray Geronymo and whatever associates he might choose from among the Spaniards who came there,  -->

<!-- Fray Geronymo wanted to restore the cause of his religious by any means, and of the conversion of Japon through their labor, as they had begun to do when the martyrs were alive—for this aim alone moved him—did not doubt that he could once and many times facilitate Daifusama's desires, and even assured him that they would certainly be realized through his help, and that there would be no difficulty whatever to prevent this.  -->

Thereupon Daifu appeared favorable and more inclined to the affairs of Manila than Taico, his predecessor, had been. 

Daifu assured the religious that:
- he would give the Spaniards a good reception in Japon, and
- the ships in distress in Japon would be equipped and despatched with all necessities
- he would not allow any Japanese to plunder or commit any injury to the Filipinas.
- the annual ships from Nangasaqui to Manila laden with flour and other goods:
  - should not be so many, but only enough to supply Manila
  - should have the permission and sanction of its governor, so that they might not be the cause of loss or injury to that place.

<!-- In fact, because he learned that six ships of Japanese corsairs had sailed that year from the island of Zazuma [Satsuma] and other ports of the lower kingdoms, and had seized and plundered two Chinese merchantmen on the way to Manila, and had done other mischief on its coast, he immediately had them sought out in his kingdom.

Having imprisoned more than four hundred men, he had them all crucified. -->


Daifu pressed Fray Geronymo more and more every day to fulfill this. 

So the Fray told him that he had already written.

 <!-- and would write again about those matters to the governor and royal Audiencia of Manila. He -->
He requested Daifu to send a servant of his household with these letters and the message, in order that they might have more credit and authority.

Daifu despatched them through Captain Chiquiro, a pagan Japanese servant of his/

<!-- , who took a present of various weapons to the governor and the letters of Fray Geronymo. -->

There was no special letter from Daifu, except that Fray Geronymo said that he wrote and petitioned in the name of Daifu. 

He explained the better condition of peace and friendship now existing between the Filipinas and Japon, and what Daifu promised and assured. 

He wrote that, in order to facilitate the above, Daifu had promised him that:
- the Spaniards could go with their ships to trade at Kanto
- the governor should send him masters and workmen to build ships for the voyage from Japon to Nueva España
- commerce and friendship with the viceroy of that country. 

He said that Daifu had already given leave for religious to go to Japon, to christianize and to found churches and monasteries, and had given him a good site for a monastery in Miaco, where he was, and that the same would be done in other parts and regions of Japon in which they might wish to settle.

Fray Geronymo insidiously and cunningly added this last to Daifu's promise in order that he might incite the religious of the Filipinas to push the matter more earnestly before the governor and Audiencia, that they might agree to this more easily, in order not to lose the great results that Fray Geronymo said were set afoot.
