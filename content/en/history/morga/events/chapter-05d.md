In 1594, when Don Luys was governor, a large junk came to the Filipinas with:
- some Cambodians and Siamese
- several Chinese
- 3 Spaniards

One was a Castilian, named Blaz Ruyz de Hernan Gonzalez.

 <!-- and the other two Portuguese called Pantaleon Carnero and Antonio Machado.  -->

They were in the city of Chordemuco, [48] in Camboja, with Prauncar [49] Langara, king of Camboja.

Then the king of Siam, with many soldiers and elephants, conquered Cambodia and seized the king's treasures.

The king, with his wife, mother, sister, and his one daughter, and two sons, fled to the kingdom of Lao.

The king of Siam left some of his captains to guard Camboja and returned home with the rest of the army.

He sent what booty he could not carry away by land to Siam by sea in several junks. 

He captured the Portuguese and Castilians in Cambodia and put them on board this junk with a Siamese guard and a Chinese crew.

 <!-- above mentioned three with other Cambodian slaves  -->

While they were at sea, the 3 Spaniards, aided by the Chinese, took possession of the junk, and killed and imprisoned the Siamese guards. 

After that, the Spaniards and the Chinese came to blows as to who should have the prize and where it was to be taken.

The 3 Spaniards overcame the Chinese, and killing most of them. They took the junk to Manila.

<!-- with all its cargo, and the vessel was adjudged to them.  -->

Liberty was granted to the Cambodians and Chinese who had survived.

The king of Sian reached his court in the city of Odia [50] and waited for the junk.


<!-- But seeing that it delayed longer than was necessary, he suspected that it had been seized or lost, and desired to send someone to bring him news of it and the reason for the delay.

Among the prisoners he had made in Camboja was the ,  -->

Portuguese Diego Belloso was sent by King Prauncar Langara to Manila to ask Dasmariñas for help against Siam.
- On his return to Camboja with the governor's answer and present, Siam had already won. 

They captured him, and the Siamese king seized the present. 

Diego Belloso offered to the Siamese king to:
- set him free back to Manila to find out what had happened to the junk
- establish friendship and commerce in the king's name with the Spaniards.

<!-- and would procure many European curiosities for him, which were to be found in Manila, especially a colored stone large enough to serve as a hilt for the two-handed sword which the king used—a thing which the king greatly desired on account of a smaller one that he had found among the presents, and which he carried before him when on his elephant.  -->

The king agreed to this and had a junk prepared.

<!-- He sent in it a Siamese who was in his service, and all the other men necessary for the voyage, together with Diego Belloso.  -->

He sent 2 elephants to the governor of Manila, and a quantity of benzoin, ivory, and other merchandise for sale, with the proceeds of which they were to buy the curiosities mentioned by Belloso.

They encountered a storm, and the junk put in at Malaca.

There they learned that:
- the other junk had been seized by its Spanish prisoners
- it was taken to Manila

 <!-- who had embarked as prisoners at Camboja, had taken it with all its cargo to Manila, after killing the Siamese guards. -->

At this news, the Siamese king's servant Aconsi wanted to return immediately to Sian.
- So they sold the goods in Malaca

<!-- began to look less favorably on the journey to Manila, and accordingly, although against Belloso's desire, began to discharge and sell  with the intention of   -->

One morning, Aconsi [51] was found dead in the junk.

 <!-- although he had retired safe and sound the night before.  -->

Diego Belloso became master of the ship. He loaded again the goods and elephants on the junk, left Malaca for Manila.

There he found Don Luys Dasmariñas acting as governor, because of his father Gomez Perez's death. 
- He gave the present of the elephants

<!-- , which he brought from the king, and told him what else had been sent.  -->

The other goods and merchandise were offered for sale by another Siamese who represented his king's service in the same junk.

Belloso met Blas Ruys de Hernan Gonçales and his two companions in Manila. 

They agreed to persuade Governor Don Luys to send a fleet to Camboja to aid King Langara.

 <!-- who was living in exile and stripped of his kingdom.  -->

<!-- They alleged that it would be easy to restore the king to power, and that at the same time the Spaniards might gain a foothold on the mainland, where they could settle and fortify themselves, whence would follow other important and more considerable results.  -->

They called on the religious of the Order of St. Dominic to support them before the governor in this plan. 

These easily put the matter on such good footing. The governor followed their advice and prepared a fleet with as many men as possible, under the captain and sargento-mayor, Juan Xuarez Gallinato
- Gallinato would be in a ship of moderate size. 
- Diego Belloso would be in a junk
- Blas Ruyz de Hernan Gonçalez would be in another. 

They had:
- 120 Spaniards
- some Japanese and natives
- all else that was necessary.

This resolution seemed inexpedient to the majority of people in the city because:
- it took so many men away
- the success of the expedition seemed very doubtful.

<!-- Admitting reports that the country of Camboja was in the hands of the king of Sian, who held it with sufficient forces—and nothing else was known—the result of the expedition would be to make the king of Sian—from whom the governor had just received presents and a friendly embassy in the person of Belloso—their declared enemy. -->

<!-- Without sending the king an answer they were about to take up arms against him in favor of one who was unknown to them, and from whom the Spaniards had received neither pledges nor obligations.

Lieutenant-general Don Antonio de Morga and Master-of-camp Diego Ronquillo, together with other captains and influential persons, spoke of this matter to Don Luys, and even requested him in writing to desist from this expedition.

But although he had no reasons on his side to satisfy them, he was so taken by the expedition, that, inasmuch as the said religious of St. Dominic upheld him, he would not change his plans. Accordingly he despatched the fleet to the kingdom of Camboja at the beginning of the year ninety-six, which is generally one week's voyage. 

On the other hand, he dismissed the Siamese who had accompanied Belloso, without any definite answer to the embassy of the king of Siam, to whom he sent in return for his presents, some products of the country, which he thought appropriate. The Siamese, seeing that they were being sent back to their country, were satisfied, and expected no other result of their coming. -->

A storm overtook the fleet. The flagship took refuge in the strait of Sincapura near Malaca, where it remained for many days. 

The other two junks which carried Diego Belloso and Blas Ruyz with some Spaniards, Japanese, and natives of Manila, reached Camboja with great difficulty.
