As soon as Gomez Perez Dasmariñas reached the Filipinas, he was received as governor with universal acclaim. 

He suppressed the Audiencia by virtue of a royal decree.

 <!-- were taken by , whom  -->

Viceroy Don Luys de Velasco sent Licentiate Herver del Coral to take over the residencias of its president, auditors, fiscal, and other officials

 <!-- for that purpose,   -->

The new governor inaugurated his rule by:
- establishing the paid garrison
- executing, with great enthusiasm and zeal, many and various things

 <!-- for which he possessed royal orders and instructions, not  -->

He did not shrink from any kind of labor, or taking any care of himself. 

His first work was the walling of the city, to which he attended so assiduously, that it was almost completed before his death. [39] 


 <!-- who had shortly before begun to build, -->

He:
- razed the fort of Nuestra Señora de Guia, which his predecessor had built
- built the cathedral of Manila in stone
- encouraged the city's inhabitants build their houses in stone
  - The bishop was the first to do this in the building of his house. 
- built a cavalier on the promontory of Manila where the old wooden fort, which he called Sanctiago, formerly stood, and fortified it with some artillery. 
- increased trade with China
- regulated better the navigation of Nueva España, and the despatch of vessels in that line
- built some galleys for the defense of the coast
- pacified the Zambales, who had revolted
- built also an artillery foundry in Manila, where, for lack of expert founders, only a few large pieces were turned out

He ordered his son Don Luys Dasmariñas, of the habit of Alcantara, to go into the interior of Luzon [40] until  Cagayan. 

 <!-- by crossing the river Ytui and other provinces not yet explored or seen by Spaniards, until -->


In the first year of his administration, he sent the president and auditors of the suppressed Audiencia to España.

Licentiate Pedro de Rojas was the senior auditor.

He remained with Dasmarinas by order of his Majesty, as lieutenant-assessor in matters of justice.
- He was later appointed alcalde in Mexico.

During Gomez Perez's administration, the peace between the Japanese and the Spaniards of the Filipinas became strained.

Japanese ships had gone from the port of Nagasaki to Manila for some years.
- They were laden with their flour and other goods

 <!-- where they had been kindly received, and despatched.  -->

But Taiko-sama, [41] lord of Japan, was incited by Farandaquiemon—a Japanese of low extraction, to demand submission and tribute.

<!-- one of those who came to Manila—to write in a barbarous and arrogant manner to the governor,

, and threatening to come with a fleet and troops to lay waste the country.  -->

The communication between them took many years until at last Taiko died. [42]

<!-- But, between demands and replies, several years were spent, -->


The Portuguese Diego Belloso brought a present of 2 elephants and offers of friendship and trade with the king of Cambodia.

That king then sent him an embassy imploring aid against Siam which was threatening Cambodia. 

The governor sent him a horse, with a few emeralds and other objects, but postponed. 

 <!-- until later what related to aid, and thanked him for his friendship. -->

This was the origin of the expeditions made later from Manila to the kingdoms of Sian and Camboja.

<!-- , on the mainland of Asia. -->

Governor Dasmarinas had wanted to lead an expedition to conquer the fort of Terrenate in Maluco because of the previous failures.

<!-- , on account of the great importance of this enterprise, and its outcome, in which no success had been attained on other occasions.  -->

He was constantly making arrangements for it in secret until 1593 when it was ready. 

 <!-- but so secretly that he declared it to no one, until, in the year , seeing that the preparations for his intention appeared sufficient, he declared his purpose, and made ready to -->

He set out in person, with more than 900 Spaniards and 200 vessels which included galleys, galliots, frigates, vireys, and other craft. 

He left the:
- war affairs of Manila and of the islands to Diego Ronquillo, his master-of-camp
- administration and justice to Licentiate Pedro de Rojas

<!-- , with a few troops, insufficient for the city's defense, in charge of  -->

He also sent his son, Don Luys Dasmariñas, forward with the rest of the fleet, as his lieutenant in the office of captain-general to Visayas.

 <!-- while he himself remained in Manila making his final preparations and  -->

The governor's galley had 28 benches, manned with paid Chinese rowers. [43]

In order to win their goodwill, they were not chained, and even had certain weapons.

About 40 Spaniards embarked on the galley which was accompanied by a few frigates and smaller vessels with private individuals.

The governor sailed from the port of Cabit, in October 1593, for the Visayas where they were to join the fleet  awaiting them there, and then go to Maluco. 

In the afternoon of the second day of the voyage, they reached the island of Caça, [44] 24 leguas from Manila.

 <!-- and close to the coast of the same island of Luzon, at a place called Punta del Açufre [Sulphur Point], where there is a strong head wind.  -->

The galley tried to round this point by rowing, but being unable to make any headway until the wind should drop, they anchored and spread an awning, and stayed there that night. 

Some of the vessels sailing with the galley went in closer to the shore in sight of the galley, and awaited it there.

The governor and those who accompanied him passed the night playing on the poop, until the end of the first watch. 

<!-- After the governor had gone into his cabin to rest, the other Spaniards went also to their quarters [45] for the same purpose, leaving the usual guards in the midship gangway, and at the bow and stern.  -->
