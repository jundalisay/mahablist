The voyages of the Dutch into the East Indies had important results for both Spain and Portugal. While they concerned themselves principally with Java and the islands of the Moluccas, they made incursions among the Philippines, where they were a constant menace for many years. The first two expeditions—that of Houtman, June 11, 1596-August 14, 1597; and that of van Neck and van Warwyck, May 1, 1598-May 30, 1600—did little but establish the custom and make beginnings in the East India trade. The first was concerned mainly with Java, but the second entered (with four of its eight vessels) the Moluccas, and brought back a load of cloves. These two expeditions also marked the beginning of troubles with the Portuguese and natives. They were both by way of the Cape of Good Hope.


VOYAGE OF OLIVER VAN NOORDT

The first voyage of great importance was that of Oliver van Noordt. In 1598 a commercial company contracted with him to conduct five vessels through the Strait of Magellan for traffic on South American coasts. This fleet sailed on September 13, 1598, going first to Plymouth, England, where an English pilot, who had been with Candish on his expedition, was engaged. After various fortunes along the eastern South American coasts, during which about one hundred men were lost, the fleet entered the Strait of Magellan November 5, 1599. Contentions between van Noordt and his vice-admiral resulted in the latter's being marooned, and the elevation to his place of Captain Pierre de Lint, while Lambert Biesman was made captain of the "Concordia." The vice-admiral and his ship were lost on March 14, 1600, which with other losses, reduced the fleet to but two vessels. On debouching from the strait the fleet cruised along the Chilean coast, alternately trading and committing depredations, and seizing prizes, and finally determined to go to the Philippines by way of the Ladrones. On September 15, the latter islands were sighted. There they met the same experience as the Spaniards from the thievishness of the natives. "These people, both men and women, seem amphibious, and to be able to live on water as well as on the land, so well do they swim and dive. Five pieces of iron were thrown into the sea to them for the pleasure of seeing them exercise themselves. One of them was skilful enough to get all five of them, and in so short a time that one can regard it as marvelous…. Their canoes are so well made … and are fifteen or twenty feet long. They are quite roomy and good sailers. They do not turn about to tack, but place the helm in what was the bow, and leave the sail, which is made of reed mats and resembles a mizzen-sail, in its same position without changing it." Thence the route to the Philippines was continued. "They are called also the Manillas, from the name of the chief port, and the city built by the Spaniards.


"Some call them the islands of Luçon, because their chief island is so named. It is said to be 100 leagues in circumference. 

There is located the city of Manile, the capital of all these islands.

They were formerly part of the crown of China, which abandoned them for some slight pretext.

After that their laws and civilization were so poorly observed that they seemed deadened when the Spaniards landed there.

In fact, the inhabitants there lived like beasts.

Each one enslaved his neighbor, if he could, and their chief occupation was mutual oppression.

This allowed the Spaniards to subdue them, which was rendered greater, since these people were simple and very stupid. 

As soon as one mentioned baptism to them, they ran to get it in droves, and became Christians to the extent desired.

However the Ilocos and others, too, who are called Pintados did not cease to give trouble to their new masters.

All these islands are densely populated and produce abundance of rice and wine made from nypa.

Deer, buffaloes, bulls, cows, swine, goats, and other live-stock are found, although formerly they had none. 

But now the care exercised by the Spaniards has made them so abundant, that they yield in no way to Nouvelle Espagne.

There are also many civet-cats, and all sorts of fruit as in China. 

They yield considerable quantities of honey and wax. They even have gold, but although the islanders pay their tribute to the Spaniards in gold, the latter have not as yet—that is in the year 1600—been able to ascertain where they get it, notwithstanding their efforts.

They are commencing to sow wheat there. Flour was formerly brought from Japon. The islands also supplied quantities of ebony and bamboo.

The Chinese engage extensively in trade there. They take all kinds of merchandise there from China, namely, silks, cottons, china-ware, gunpowder, sulphur, iron, steel, quicksilver, copper, flour, walnuts, chestnuts, biscuits, dates, all sorts of stuffs, writing-desks, and other curiosities.

The Spaniards load all this merchandise in Manila and export it to Nouvelle Espagne, whence more than one and one-half millions of silver in money and in bars is taken annually to the Philippines. 

This silver is exchanged for gold, giving four livres of silver for one of gold.

But this traffic is not extensive, since there is enough gold in Pérou and Chili. They prefer to traffic with the Chinese, for their returns reach 1,000%.

The city of Manille is located in 14 degrees of north latitude. 

There is situated the residence of the Spanish governor, who rules all the islands.

The archbishop also lives there. He has supreme authority in the ecclesiastical affairs of all the same islands, where there are also three bishops suffragan to himself."

On October 14, 1600, the Dutch sighted the cape of Espiritu Santo, whence they steered toward Manila.

On the 16th their first encounter with the Spanish in the islands occurred, but the Dutch reassured the latter by flying a Spanish pennant, and declaring themselves to be French commissioned by the Spanish monarch.

Consequently they were allowed to buy provisions freely, in return for which the natives demanded money.

The majority of these Indians were naked.

Some wore a cloth garment, while some were even clad like Spaniards.

The chiefs, who belong to the former race of commanders of the country, and who yet remember that fact, have their skin cut or pricked very skilfully and singularly. These cuts or pricks have been made with iron and never fade.

Besides this is a wretched race, who have no weapons, so that the Spaniards tyrannize over them at will. 

They make them pay a tribute of 3 reals, that is, a trifle less than three Dutch florins, per head, all men or women above 20 years.

There are very few Spaniards in each district.

They have a priest, whom the inhabitants of the place revere greatly, so much so that only lack of priests prevents them from holding all these islands in servitude.

Even in places where there are neither priests nor Spaniards they have made the people pay tribute.

The Spaniards at last became suspicious of the foreigners and demanded to see their commission, upon which the one given by the prince of Orange was produced, whereat great consternation reigned, and the Dutch were forbidden more provisions.

The latter continuing their course entered the Manila strait on October 24, anchoring near Capul. 

On landing near here, one of the crew, Jean Caleway [i.e., John Calleway], an Englishman, and a musician, was somehow left behind, and it was conjectured that the natives had seized him. 

November 1, the vessels left Capul for Manila, sailing among the various islands, and committing some depredations on Spanish, native, and Chinese vessels.
