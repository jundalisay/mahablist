From a Chinese pilot, van Noordt gained certain information concerning Manila.

The houses of the city of Manila are built close together. The city is surrounded by a rampart supported by a wall.

More than 15,000 Chinese live outside its walls. 

They engage in their business together, and are given to various industries.

In addition more than 400 vessels go there annually from China, from the city and province of Chincheo, laden with silks and all sorts of merchandise.

They take back silver money in return.

They come at a certain fixed time, namely, after the month of December or between Christmas and Easter. 

At the beginning of this present month of November … two Japanese vessels also generally sail to Manila, laden with iron, flour, bacon, and other food….

The walls of the city of Manila and the houses are built of stone, in the modern fashion.

It is so large and extensive that the Spaniards have had a second wall built inside the city of less size than the first, within which to retire in case of need…. 

It was made especially in consideration of the Japanese, of whom the Spaniards are very suspicious.

The governor, who resembles a viceroy, lives in Manille, as does also the archbishop.

Besides the cathedral there are several other beautiful churches.

All the inhabitants of these islands are either Christians or pagans. 

All the Moros or Mahometans have all been exterminated.


The Dutch continued their depredations, and sent a letter by an Indian to the governor, notifying him that they were going to visit him.

Biesman was sent on a scouting expedition, from which he finally returned, after having been considered lost by some of the Dutch.

The island of Manille, called Luçon by its inhabitants, is larger than England and Scotland together. [167]

There are other various islands about it, also very large."

From a Japanese vessel some provisions were obtained, and the vessel was allowed to continue its course to Manila.

The depredations of the Dutch were called to a sudden halt by the 2 Spanish vessels sent out under Dr. Morga on December 14, 1600, when ensued the fight described in Morga. [168] 

Van Noordt inspired his men with new courage by threatening to blow up the vessel unless they fought more bravely.

The Dutch found "a little silver box containing little tickets filled with prayers and devotions to various saints, to obtain their protection in times of peril," on the dead body of a Spaniard.

"The two Spanish vessels had about 500 men, both Spaniards and natives, and 10 cannon." 

The Dutch flagship finally returned to Holland by way of Borneo, and Cape of Good Hope, reaching Rotterdam August 26, 1601. [169]
