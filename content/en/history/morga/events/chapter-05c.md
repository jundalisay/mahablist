Before starting the expedition to Maluco, Governor Dasmarinas had sent "San Felipe" and "San Francisco" to Nueva España.

Both of them had to return because of heavy storms.
- The "San Felipe" returned to the port of Sebu
- The "San Francisco" returned to Manila

<!-- , and they were unable to resail until the following year.  -->

Nueva España suspected that there were troubles in the islands because of their non-arrival.

 <!-- of the ships, and persons were not wanting to affirm more than had really happened; nor was it possible at the same time—in the town of Mexico—to ascertain whence the news had emanated.  -->

This was very shortly known in España, by way of India, letters having been sent to Venecia [Venice], through Persia.

Immediately they set about appointing a new governor.

In the first year of the government of Gomez Perez Dasmariñas, the need of an Audiencia was felt by many.

This was because:
- all the power vested in one man. 
- there was no one to whom they could apply for remedy for certain cases. [47] 

Bishop Fray Domingo de Salazar felt this most keenly.

He had disputes with the governor. 

The governor allowed him to go to España despite his old age so that he could be rid of him.

But he sent Fray Francisco de Ortega of the Augustinian order with him to defend Dasmarinas. 

Both reached España, and each spoke as his interests demanded.

The bishop requested:
- the reëstablishment of the Audiencia
- the foundation of other bishoprics in the Filipinas, besides that of Manila
- other things which he thought beneficial to the spiritual and temporal welfare.

He was opposed by Ortega. 

But the authority and piety of the bishop were of such weight.

<!-- , that, although at first the cause that made him, at his advanced age, leave his church, and travel 5,000 leguas to España, seemed trivial, afterward -->

He was favorably received by his Majesty and the Council. All his petitions and propositions were considered and discussed at length.

<!-- Many consultations were held with his Majesty, in order to have a decision passed upon them. -->

The office of lieutenant-assessor in judicial matters had been filled by Licentiate Pedro de Roxas since the suppression of the Audiencia.
- The Council resolved in 1593 that it should be upgraded into lieutenant-general.
<!-- In the same year of ninety-three in which Gomez Perez died in the Filipinas,  after consulting with his Majesty, -->
<!-- , should be made more important than formerly in order to facilitate matters;  -->
<!-- the title of the office should thereafter be that of ;  -->

The lieutenant-general would have authority to hear cases of appeal not exceeding the value of 1,000 Castilian ducados in judicial matters.

Licentiate Pedro de Rojas was promoted as alcalde of Mexico.

Doctor Antonio de Morga was appointed by his Majesty to take his residencia as lieutenant-general of the Filipinas.

<!-- In the course of his journey the latter arrived at Nueva España in the beginning of the year ninety-four, and found that the ships which, as abovesaid, had failed to come from the Filipinas, had not arrived. -->

The death of Dasmarinas and other events were only known with the arrival of Don Juan de Velasco in November 1593 in the galleon "Sanctiago".

It had been sent to the islands the year before by Viceroy Don Luys de Velasco, with the necessary supplies.

<!-- He brought news of the governor's death and of the succession to the office by the latter's son, Don Luys Dasmariñas. Men and fresh supplies for the islands were prepared immediately and together with many passengers and religious from España,  -->

Doctor Antonio de Morga embarked in the port of Acapulco, in the galleons "San Felipe" and "Santiago," with everything under his charge.

He set sail March 22, 1595 and arrived under fair weather in the port of Cabit, June 11.

<!-- He entered his office as lieutenant-general. and began to occupy himself with his duties and the other matters in his charge. -->

<!-- While Don Luys Dasmariñas was governing, the suspicions and fear of Xapon continued. Together with the Chinese trouble, this kept the people in continual anxiety. 

The governor sent his cousin, Don Fernando de Castro, with letters and despatches to the viceroy of Canton and to that of Chincheo, where many of the Chinese who had seized the galley and killed Governor Gomez Perez, were thought to be found.

Supposing that they had gone there with the galley, the governor requested the Chinese authorities to deliver the culprits for punishment, and to restore the royal standard, artillery, and other things which had been seized. 

This was not obtained, for as the galley had gone to Cochinchina, and the Chinese had dispersed in so many directions, it could not be effected. However, after several days, some of the guilty Chinese were brought from Malaca to Manila, having been captured there by the chief captain, Francisco de Silva de Meneses. From these men more accurate information was derived concerning what had happened in the seizure of the galley and of the governor's death, and justice was dealt them. -->
