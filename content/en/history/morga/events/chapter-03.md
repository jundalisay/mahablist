### The First Bishop of the Philippines: Don Fray Domingo de Salazar

During the administration of Don Gonzalo Ronquillo, the first bishop of the Filipinas was appointed.

He was Don Fray Domingo de Salazar, of the Dominican order, a man of great learning and piety. 

<!-- As soon as he arrived in the islands, he took upon himself the management and jurisdiction of ecclesiastical affairs, which were at first in -->

He took charge of:
- the Augustinian friars who had come during the conquest
- the discalced Franciscan religious, who had arrived at the time of the conversion. 

The bishop erected his cathedral in the city of Manila, by apostolic bulls, with prebends paid by the royal exchequer, until there should be tithes and ecclesiastical revenues to maintain themselves. 

<!-- Moreover, he provided whatever else was necessary for the service and decoration of the church, and for the divine worship which is celebrated there with great solemnity and display.  -->

He took Antonio Sedeño and Alonso Sanchez, both priests and grave members of the Society of Jesus, with him. 

They were the first to establish the Society of Jesus in the Filipinas.

<!-- , which, since that time, has been steadily growing, to the great profit and fruit of the teaching and conversion of the natives, consolation of the Spaniards, and the education and teaching of their children in the studies which they pursue. -->

Don Gonzalo Ronquillo died in 1583.

<!-- , and his body was buried in the monastery of St. Augustine in Manila. -->

His kinsman, Diego Ronquillo, by virtue of his appointment through a decree of his Majesty, succeeded him.

<!-- in the governorship; this man continued what Don Gonzalo had commenced, especially in the assistance for Maluco and pacification for other islands. -->

During the same term of Diego Ronquillo, a fire broke out in Manila, which started at midday in the church of the convent of St. Augustine.

 <!-- while the doors of the church were closed. -->

The fire increased so rapidly that all the city was burned in a few hours, as it was built of wood. 

There was great loss of goods and property. The city was rebuilt with great difficulty and labor, leaving the Spaniards very poor and needy. [32]

This led to the order to establish a royal Audiencia in Manila.
- Its president was to be governor and captain-general of all the Filipinas. 

 <!-- main result of the matters treated at court by Mariscal Gabriel de Ribera was (although at that time the death of Governor Don Gonzalo Ronquillo was unknown)   -->

<!-- In view of this, the necessary instructions were issued, and  -->

The presidency was given to Doctor Sanctiago de Vera, alcalde of the Audiencia of Mexico, and a native of the town of Alcala de Henares. 

He went to the Filipinas with the usual reënforcements from Nueva España, taking with him:
- the royal seal of the Audiencia
- the auditors whom his Majesty was sending
- the fiscal
- other officials and assistants

The auditors and fiscal were:
- Licentiates Melchior de Avalos
- Pedro de Rojas
- Gaspar de Ayala—[the latter] as fiscal

At the end of 2 years, Don Antonio de Ribera went as third auditor.

<!-- Of the administration of Doctor Sanctiago de Vera, and of the establishment of the Manila Audiencia, and until its suppression; and of events during his term. -->
