<!-- For the rest of 1605, until ships could go to Castilla, [190] the governor repaired the city, and supplied it with provisions and ammunition, with the special object and care that the decision which he was awaiting from the court for making an expedition to Maluco—of which he had been advised and warned—should not find him so unprepared as to cause him to delay the expedition. 

In this he was very successful, for at that same time, the master-of-camp, Joan de Esquivel, had arrived in Mexico with 600 soldiers from España. -->


His Majesty had ordered the expedition to Maluco.

So Nueva España sent in March 1605 men, ammunition, food, money, and arms to Manila. 

<!-- - And so in Mexico, more men were being enrolled and a great preparation was made of , which the -->


<!-- All this arrived safely and in due season at Manila.

Shortly after the ships had left Manila for Nueva España.

Those despatched thence by the viceroy had entered, Archbishop Don Fray Miguel de Benavides died of a long illness.

His body was buried amid the universal devotion and grief of the city. [191]  -->

<!-- , carrying out his dearest wish, was to make the expedition to Terrenate in the Malucos, which should be done quickly, before the enemy could gather more strength than he had then; for he had been informed that  -->


The governor was informed that the Dutch had:
- seized the island and fortress of Amboino and Tidore.
- driven out the Portuguese
- entered Terrenate, where they had established a trading-post for the clove-trade.

<!-- Accordingly, as soon as the despatches in regard to this undertaking arrived from España, in June 1605, and the men and supplies from Nueva España, which were brought at the same time by the master-of-camp, Joan de Esquivel, the governor spent the balance of this year in preparing the ships, men, and provisions that he deemed necessary for the undertaking.

Leaving behind in Manila sufficient force for its defense, he went to the provinces of Pintados, where the fleet was collected, in the beginning of the year six hundred and six. -->

By March 15, the governor had thoroughly prepared the fleet—which consisted of:
- 5 ships
- 4 galleys with poop-lanterns [galeras de fanal]
- 3 galliots
- 4 champans
- 3 funeas
- 2 English lanchas
- 2 brigantines
- 1 barca chata [194] for the artillery
- 13 fragatas with high freeboard.

There were 1,300 Spaniards, counting regulars, captains and officers, substitutes [entretenidos], and volunteers. 

Among them were some Portuguese captains and soldiers, under charge of the chief captain of Tidore [195]

 <!-- who was at that island when the Dutch seized it. -->

These Portuguese came from Malaca to serve in the expedition.

There were also 400 Indian pioneers—Tagáls and Pampangos of Manila—who went to serve at their own cost, under their own officers, and with their own weapons.

<!-- There was a quantity of artillery of all kinds, ammunition, tools, and provisions for nine months. [196] , which is near the town of Arevalo in the island of Panai, [on the above day] with all this equipment, and  -->

Don Pedro de Acuña left Hilohilo coasting the island of Mindanao, made port at La Caldera, in order to replenish his water, wood, and other necessaries.

<!-- The governor embarked in the galley "Santiago" and took under his charge the other galleys and oared vessels.  -->

The ship "Jesus Maria" was flagship commanded by Joan de Esquivel.

Captain and Sargento-mayor Cristoval de Azcueta Menchaca acted as admiral of the fleet, which, after attending to its necessities at La Caldera, left that port.

But it was heavy and the currents drove it shoreward, grounding it. 

 <!-- so that, without the others being able to help it, it grounded. -->

It was wrecked there, but the crew, artillery, and a portion of its ammunition and clothing, were saved.

It was burned so that the Mindanaos could not make use of them, the fleet continued its voyage.

<!-- , and taking what nails and bolts they could,  -->

The galleys coasted along the island of Mindanao. The ships and other deep-draught vessels sailed in the open sea, all making for the port of Talangame, in the island of Terrenate. 

The vessels experienced some changes of weather, first sighted the islands of Maluco.

After they had been reconnoitered by a large Dutch ship, well equipped with artillery, which was anchored at Terrenate.

This vessel fired some heavy artillery at our vessels, and then immediately entered the port, where it fortified itself under shelter of the land, and with its artillery and crew and the people of Terrenate.

Esquivel went to the island of Tidore where he was well received by the Moro chiefs and cachils.
- The king was away to the island of Bachan to be married.

He found 4 Dutch factors there, who were trading for cloves.

The ship at Terrenate was from Holland. It had sailed from Amboino and seized Tidore driving out the  Portuguese. It was being laden with cloves. 

It was awaiting other vessels of its convoy. They had made friendship and treaties with Tidore and Terrenate, in order to be protected against the Castilians and Portuguese.

Esquivel summoned the king of Tidore immediately. While awaiting Don Pedro de Acuña, rested his men and cleaned the ships, and made gabions and other things necessary for the war.
