The Chinese rowers conspired 3 days before to seize the galley in order to:
- avoid the labor of rowing on this expedition
- get the money, jewels, and other articles of value aboard the vessel

<!-- —thought that they should not lose their opportunity. Having provided candles, and white shirts with which to clothe themselves, and appointed chiefs for its execution, they carried out their plan that same night, in the last watch before dawn, when they perceived that the Spaniards were asleep.  put on their shirts,-->

At a signal, they all lit their candles, and catan [46] in hand, attacked the guards and the men who slept in the quarters [ballesteras] and in the wales, and seized the galley. 

A few of the Spaniards escaped, some by swimming ashore, others by means of the galley's tender, which was at the stern.

When the governor heard the noise from his cabin, thinking that the galley was dragging and that the crew were lowering the awning and taking to the oars, he hurried carelessly out bareheaded through the hatchway of the cabin. 

Several Chinese were awaiting him there and split his head with a catan. 

Thus wounded, he fell down the stairs into his cabin. His 2 servants carried him to his bed, where he immediately died.

The servants met the same fate from the stabs given them through the hatch. 

The only surviving Spaniards in the galley were:
- Juan de Cuellar, the governor's secretary
- Father Montilla of the Franciscan order

They were sleeping in the cabin amidships, and remained there without coming out.

The Chinese did not think that there were more Spaniards. 

The next day, they took the 2 men out and put them ashore on the coast of Ylocos in Luzon so that the natives would give them water which they badly needed.

<!-- might allow them to take water on shore, -->

The Spaniards in the other vessels saw the lights and heard the noise in the galley. They thought that some work was being done. 

<!-- ; and when shortly afterward, they learned what was happening from those who had escaped by swimming, they could render no assistance and kept still, as everything was lost, and they were few and not in sufficient force therefor.  -->

They waited for the morning, and when it began to dawn, they saw that the galley had already set its bastard, and was sailing, wind astern toward China, and they were unable to pursue it.

The galley sailed with a favorable wind all along the coast of the island until leaving it.

It took some water at Ylocos, where the secretary and the religious were abandoned. 

 <!-- not being able to fetch it, they ported -->
The Chinese tried to make for China, but ended up in the kingdom of Cochinchina, where the king of Tunquin seized:
- their cargo
- 2 large pieces of artillery which were intended for the expedition of Maluco
- the royal standard
- all the jewels, money, and articles of value

The galley was left to drift ashore.

The Chinese dispersed and fled to different provinces. 

The Governor's death ended the expedition to Maluco and his administration.

<!-- , which the governor had undertaken, ceased also.  -->

<!-- Thus ended his administration, after he had ruled somewhat more than 3 years. -->

Among other despatches Dasmariñas brought from España was authorization from his Majesty for  him to appoint his successor in case of death.

<!-- , until such time as his Majesty should appoint his successor.  -->

<!-- He showed this order to several of the most important persons of the island, giving each one to understand that he would be appointed, especially to Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa, an inhabitant of Pintados, a rich man of merit, and one of the first conquerors of the land.

To him the governor showed an appointment drawn in his favor. He made use of the captain on all occasions and had him go with himself to Maluco.  -->

The news of the seizure of the galley was soon known in Manila.

Its citizens and soldiers assembled at the house of Licentiate Pedro de Rojas to discuss measures. 

They elected Rojas as governor and captain-general.

Then they sent Captain Don Juan Ronquillo del Castillo and other captains with 2 frigates (for there were no other vessels) in pursuit of the galley.
- It was a fruitless attempt, for the galley was nowhere to be seen.

The new governor also sent a message to Don Luis Dasmariñas and ordered them to return quickly to Manila which was almost deserted.

<!-- and to the army and fleet who were awaiting Gomez Perez in Pintados, informing him of the latter's death and of what had happened, as well as of his own recent election to affairs of government.  -->

 <!-- and without the necessary precautions for any emergency. -->

The news caused great grief in the fleet. 

Don Luys Dasmariñas and Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa each was certain that he would become governor.

<!-- , taking it for granted that the governor had nominated him for the office.  -->

<!-- With this hope, both of them with the best ships and crews of the fleet, set sail together for Manila with the utmost speed. -->

<!-- Licentiate Pedro de Rojas, anxious about this provision, which the governor would leave among his papers and drawers deposited in the monastery of St. Augustine in Manila, in the possession of Fray Diego Muñoz, prior and commissary of the Holy Office, made the effort to gain possession of them.

Although he seized some of them, he did not find the said provision, for the prior had anticipated him and set aside one of the drawers, in which the provision was supposed to be found, to await Don Luys Dasmariñas's arrival in the city. -->

Juan de Cuellar, who had escaped from the galley, arrived from Ylocos. He testified that Gomez Perez had appointed a successor but did not state whom.

 <!-- to the governorship had been made by , but he ; or among what papers the nomination could be found. Thereupon the licentiate Pedro de Rojas and those devoted to him became more anxious. -->

40 days passed. Don Luis appeared in Manila bay with Estevan Rodriguez and many men.

<!-- ; and there he anchored, not choosing to enter the city, or to disembark.  -->

This caused a search for the papers kept in St. Augustine. Among them was the royal order and the nomination of Don Luys Dasmariñas to succeed to the governorship. 

<!-- One of his partisans announced the fact to , who, changing their ideas, and notwithstanding some opposition from  -->

The partisans of Licentiate Rojas did not like it.

Yet, the city magistrates made Don Luys Dasmariñas governor. 

 <!-- house and placed him in possession of the government.  -->

<!-- The same was done by the soldiers whom Don Luys had with him, and by the fleet. Each day brought a new disappointment to Licentiate Rojas, who returned to his office of lieutenant-assessor, after a rule of forty days. -->

<!-- The death of Governor Gomez Perez Dasmariñas was a great loss both in his person and the  conquest of Terrenate. -->

The return of the fleet in Manila was fortunate. 

There arrived in Manila many Chinese ships which carried many men and little merchandise, and 7 mandarins bearing the insignia of their office to try to seize the country. 

<!-- This gave sufficient motive for suspecting that they had heard of the departure of the fleet for Maluco and of the city's lack of defense, and that they had therefore come on this occasion to try to seize the country.  -->

But they desisted from the attempt when they found the city with more troops than ever.

They returned to China.

<!-- without showing any other particular motive for coming, and without either side showing that their motives were understood; except that Governor Don Luys was watchful and on his guard. He took the proper measures, especially those concerning the Chinese, and their settlement and Parián. -->
