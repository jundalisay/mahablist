As soon as the ships "Jesus Maria" and "Espiritu Sancto" sailed for Nueva España, and the ship "Sanctiago" with the religious for Japon, there was more time to discuss further the matter started by the coming of the Chinese mandarins.

For finding themselves unoccupied with other matters, fear of the Sangleys became universal.

The suspicions that were current that the Sangleys were about to commit some mischievous outbreak. This the archbishop and some religious affirmed and told, publicly and privately.

At this time, many Chinese were living in Manila and its environs. 

Some of them were baptized Christians living in the settlements of Baibai and Minondoc, [176] on the other side of the river, opposite the city.

Most of them were infidels, occupied and living in these same settlements and in the shops of the parián in the city. They were employed as merchants and in all other occupations. 

The majority of them were fishermen, stonecutters, charcoal-burners, porters, masons, and day-laborers.

Greater security was always felt in regard to the merchants, for they are the better class of people, and those who are most interested, because of their property.

So great security was not felt about the others, even though they were Christians; because, as they are a poor and covetous people. 

They were inclined to any act of meanness.

They would not cause any commotion unless a strong fleet from China came, which they could rely on.

Talk continued to increase daily, and with it suspicion. 

Some of the Chinese, both infidels and Christians, in order to prove themselves friends of the Spaniards told the Spaniards that there was to be an insurrection shortly.

<!-- , and clean from all guilt, even 

, and other similar things. -->

<!-- Although the governor always considered these statements as fictions and the exaggerations of that nation, and did not credit them, yet he was not so heedless that he did not act cautiously and watch, although with dissembling, for whatever might happen.  -->

The governor took pains to have the city guarded and the soldiers armed, besides flattering the most prominent of the Chinese and the merchants, whom he assured of their lives and property. 

The natives of La Pampanga and other provinces near by were instructed beforehand to supply the city with rice and other provisions, and to come to reënforce it with their persons and arms, should necessity arise.

The same was done with some Japanese in the city.

As all this was done with some publicity, since it could not be done secretly, as so many were concerned, one and all became convinced of the certainty of the danger.

Many even desired it, in order to see the peace disturbed, and to have the opportunity to seize something. [177] From that time, both in the city and its environs, where the Sangleys were living scattered, these people began to persecute the Sangleys by word and deed. 

The natives, Japanese and soldiers of the camp took from them their possessions and inflicted on them other ill-treatment, calling them dogs and traitors, and saying that they knew well that they meant to rebel.

But they said they would kill all the Sangleys first, and that very soon, for the governor was preparing for it. This alone was sufficient to make it necessary for the Sangleys to do what they had no intention of doing. [178] 

Some of the most clever and covetous set themselves to rouse the courage of the others, and to make themselves leaders, telling the Sangleys that their destruction was sure, according to the determination which they saw in the Spaniards, unless they should anticipate the latter, since they [the Sangleys] were so numerous, and attack and capture the city.

They said that it would not be difficult for them to kill the Spaniards, seize their possessions, and become masters of the country, with the aid and reënforcements that would immediately come to them from China, as soon as the auspicious beginning that they would have made in the matter should be known. 

In order to do this when the time came, it was advisable to build a fort and quarters in some retired and strong place near the city, where the people could gather and unite, and where arms and supplies could be provided for the war. 

At least such a fort would be sufficient to assure there their lives from the outrages that they were expecting from the Spaniards. It was learned that the chief mover in this matter was a Christian Sangley, an old-time resident in the country, named Joan Bautista de Vera. [179] 

He was rich and highly esteemed by the Spaniards, and feared and respected by the Sangleys. He had often been governor of the latter, and had many godchildren and dependents. He had become an excellent Spaniard, and was courageous.

He himself, exercising duplicity and cunning, did not leave the city, or the houses of the Spanish during this time, in order to arouse less suspicion of himself. From there he managed the affair through his confidants; and in order to assure himself better of the result, and to ascertain the number of men of his race, and to make a census and list of them, he cunningly had each of them ordered to bring him a needle, which he pretended to be necessary for a certain work that he had to do.

These needles he placed, as he received them, in a little box; and when he took them out of it, he found that he had sufficient men for his purpose. They began to construct the fort or quarters immediately at a distance of slightly more than one-half legua from the village of Tondo, among some estuaries and swamps, and in a hidden location. [180]

They stored there some rice and other provisions, and weapons of little importance. The Sangleys began to gather there, especially the masses—the common people and day-laborers; for those of the parián, and the mechanics, although urged to do the same, did not resolve to do it, and remained quiet, guarding their houses and property. 

The restlessness of the Sangleys daily continued to become more inflamed.

This, and the advices given to the governor and the Spaniards, kept the latter more anxious and apprehensive, and made them talk more openly of the matter. 

The Sangleys, seeing that their intention was discovered, and that delay might be of so great harm to them, determined, although the insurrection was planned for St. Andrew's day, the last of November, to anticipate that day, and to lose no more time. 

On Friday, October 3, the eve of St. Francis, they collected very hurriedly in the above-mentioned fort.

By nightfall, there were 2,000 men in it.

Joan Bautista de Vera was a thief disguised as an honest man.

He was the leader and organizer of the treason.

He went immediately to the city and told the governor that the Sangleys:
- had risen
- were collecting on the other side of the river. 

The governor, suspecting the mischief, had him immediately arrested and carefully guarded.

He was afterwards executed. 

Then, without tap of drum, the governor ordered the companies, both of the camp and the city, to be notified, and all to hold their arms in readiness.

Very shortly after nightfall, Don Luys Dasmariñas, who was living near the monastery and church of Minondoc, on the other side of the river, came hurriedly to the city to advise the governor that the Sangleys had revolted. 

He asked for 20 soldiers to go to the other side [of the river], where he would guard the said monastery.

Cristoval de Axqueta, sargento-mayor of the camp, went with these men, together with Don Luys.

As the silence of night deepened, the noise made by the Sangleys grew louder, for they were continuing to assemble and were sounding horns and other instruments, after their fashion.

Don Luys remained to guard the monastery, with the men brought from Manila, where he had placed in shelter many women and children of Christian Sangleys, with the religious. 

The sargento-mayor returned immediately to the city, where he told of what was being done. 

The call to arms was sounded, for the noise and shouts of the Sangleys, who had sallied out to set fire to some houses in the country, was so great that it was thought that they were devastating that district. 

The Sangleys burned a stone country-house belonging to Captain Estevan de Marquina. He and his wife and children died except a little girl who hid in a thicket. [181] 

Thence the Sangleys went to the settlement of Laguio, [182] situated on the shore of the river, and burned it. 

They killed several natives and the rest fled to the city.

There the gates were already shut and all the people, with arms in hand, manned the walls and other suitable posts, ready for any emergency, until dawn.

The enemy, who now had many men, retired to their fort, to make another sally thence with more force.
