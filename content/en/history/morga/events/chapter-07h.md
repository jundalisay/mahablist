In March 1603, a ship from China came to Manila with 3 great mandarins in the service of their king. 

<!-- The governor gave them permission to leave their ship and enter the city with their suites.  -->

 
In very curious chairs of ivory and fine gilded woods, borne on the shoulders of men, they went straight to the royal houses of the Audiencia, where the governor was awaiting them.

 <!-- with a large suite of captains and soldiers throughout the house and through the streets where they passed. -->

<!-- When they had reached the doors of the royal houses they alighted from their chairs and entered on foot, leaving in the street the banners, plumes, lances and other very showy insignia which they brought with them.  -->

The mandarins went into a large, finely-decorated hall, where the governor received them standing, they making many bows and compliments to him after their fashion, and he replying to them after his. 

They told him through the interpreters that their king had sent them, with a Chinaman whom they had with them in chains.

They wanted to see an island of gold, called Cabit, which he said belonged to no one. [162] 

They said that this man had asked for ships to take this gold.
- If it were a lie, then they could punish him with his life.

<!-- So they had come to ascertain and tell their king what there was in the matter. -->

The governor replied briefly, saying only that they were welcome, and appointed them quarters in 2 houses within the city which had been prepared for them, in which they and their men could lodge.

He said that the business would be discussed afterwards.

Thereupon they left the royal houses again, and at the doors mounted in their chairs on the shoulders of their servants, who were dressed in red, and were carried to their lodgings, where the governor ordered them to be supplied fully with whatever they needed during the days of their stay.

The coming of these mandarins seemed suspicious. Their purpose to be different from what they said, because it seemed a fiction for people, of so much understanding as the Chinese, to say that their king was sending them on this business.

<!-- Among the Chinese themselves who came to Manila at the same time in 8 merchant ships, and among those who lived in the city,  -->

They were told by local Chinese that these mandarins were coming to see the land and study its nature because the king of China wanted to attack with 100,000 men before the end of the year, to take the country.

The governor and the Audiencia thought that:
- they should be very careful in guarding the city
- these mandarins should be well treated, but they should not go out of the city

These mandarins were beginning to administer justice among the Sangleys. They were told not to do it. 
- This made the mandarins were somewhat angry. 
 <!-- nor be allowed to administer justice, as they were , at which  -->

He asked them to treat of their business, and then to return to China quickly.

He warned the Spaniards not to show that they understood or were suspicious of anything other than what the mandarins had said.

The mandarins had another interview with the governor, and he told them more clearly,

The governer told the mandarins that:
- their coming was some joke
- he was astonished that their king would believe that Chinaman
- the country belonged to his Majesty.

 <!-- whom they had with them had said, and even if it were true that there was so much gold in the Filipinas, that the Spaniards would not allow it to be carried away, since   -->

<!-- The mandarins said that they understood very well what the governor had communicated to them, but that their king had ordered them to come and that they must needs obey and bring him a reply, and that when they had performed their duty, that was all, and they would return.  -->

The governor, to cut short the business, sent the mandarins, with their servants and the prisoner, to Cabit, which is the port, 2 leguas from the city. 

There they were received with a great artillery salute, which was fired suddenly as they landed, at which they were very frightened and fearful.

When they had landed, they asked the prisoner if that was the island of which he had spoken to the king, and he replied that it was.

They asked him where the gold was, and he replied that everything there was gold and that he would make his statement good with the king. They asked him other questions and he always replied the same thing. 

Everything was written down in the presence of some Spanish captains who were there with some confidential interpreters. 

The mandarins ordered a basketful of earth to be taken from the ground, to take to the king of China, and then, having eaten and rested, they returned to Manila the same day, with the prisoner.

The interpreters said that the prisoner, when hard pressed by the mandarins to answer their questions.

<!-- what he had meant to tell the king of China was that -->

He had said that there was much gold and wealth in the hands of the natives and Spaniards of Manila.

If they gave him a fleet with men, he offered, as a man who had been in Luzon and knew the country, to capture it and bring the ships back laden with gold and riches. 

This, together with what some Chinamen had said at the beginning, seemed very much to have more meaning than the mandarins had implied, especially to Don Fray Miguel de Benavides, archbishop-elect of Manila, who knew the language. 

Thereupon the archbishop and other religious warned the governor and the city, publicly and privately, to look to its defense, because they felt sure of the coming of the Chinese fleet against it shortly.

Then the governor dismissed the mandarins and embarked them on their ship, with their prisoner, after giving them some pieces of silver and other things with which they were pleased.

The people thought unreasonable that the Chinese would attack. 

Yet the governor began covertly to:
- prepare ships and other things suitable for defense
- completed extensive repairs on:
  - the fort of Sanctiago at the point of the river
  - the fort he built on the inside a wall of great strength, with its wings, facing toward the parade ground.

<!-- on the eve of Sts. Philip and James [Santiago] -->

<!-- At the end of April 1603, 3pm a fire started in a little field house [casilla de zacate] used by some Indians and negroes of the native hospital in the city.

passed to other houses so quickly, with the force of the rather fresh wind, that it could not be stopped, and burned houses of wood and stone, even the monastery of St. Dominic—house and church—the royal hospital for the Spaniards, and the royal warehouses, without leaving a building standing among them. 

14 people died in the fire, Spaniards, Indians, and negroes, and among them Licentiate Sanz, canon of the cathedral.

260 houses were burned, with much property which was in them, and it was understood that the damage and loss amounted to more than one million [pesos].
