The daring and audacity of the Mindanaos and Joloans in making incursions with their fleets into Bisayas led to the expectation that they would come to Manila. 

So at the start of 1602, Governor Don Francisco Tello decided for an expedition against Jolo immediately with the forces whom Captain and Sargento-mayor Joan Xuarez Gallinato held in Sebu and in the Pintados, together with more men, ships, and provisions, which were sent him, accompanied by the necessary documents and instructions for him to enter the island.

 <!-- chastise its king and inhabitants, and pacify and reduce it to the obedience of his Majesty.  -->

<!-- By this means, until there should be an opportunity to settle the affairs of Mindanao, which is quite near Jolo, the audacity of the enemy would be checked; and by bringing the war into his own country, he would not come out to commit depredations. -->

Captain Gallinato set out with 200 Spanish soldiers, ships, artillery, enough provisions for 4 months.

<!-- —the time which it was thought the expedition would last—and with Indians as rowers for the ships and for other services that might arise. , at the bar of the river of this island, which is -->

He arrived at Jolo 2 leguas from the principal town and dwellings of the king.

 <!-- he landed his men, artillery, and the necessary provisions and left his ships under a sufficient guard.  -->

The islanders were all in the town and dwellings of the king, which are situated on a very high hill above some cliffs, and have two roads of approach through paths and roads so narrow that they can be reached only in single file. 

They had fortified the whole place, intrenched it with palms and other woods, and a number of culverins. 

They had also collected provisions and water for their sustenance, besides a supply of arquebuses and other weapons.

They had neither women nor children with them, for they had taken them out of the island. They had requested aid from the people of Mindanao, Borney, and Terrenate, and were awaiting the same, since they had been informed of the fleet which was being prepared against them in the Pintados.

Gallinato determined to pitch his camp near the town, before this aid should arrive, and to attack the fort.

After he had quartered himself at a distance of one-half legua, in a plain facing the ascent, he sent interpreters with messages to the king and chiefs of the island, calling on them to surrender, and telling them that good terms would be given them. While waiting for an answer, he fortified his quarters in that spot, intrenching himself wherever necessary. He mounted the artillery in the best position for use, and kept his men ready for any emergency.

A false and deceptive answer was returned, making excuses for the excesses that had been committed, and for not complying just then with what had been asked of them, and making loud promises to do so later. All this was with the object of detaining the captain in that place, which is very unhealthy, until the rains should set in, his provisions run short, and the arrival of the expected aid. After this answer had been received the Joloans, thinking that the Spaniards had become more careless on account of it, swarmed down quickly from the said fort in a large body of probably somewhat over one thousand; and armed with arquebuses and other weapons with handles, campilans, and caraças, attacked and assaulted the quarters and camp of the Spaniards.

This could not be done so secretly as not to be seen by the Spaniards, and allow them opportunity to prepare to receive the Joloans before their arrival. This the Spaniards did, and having permitted the natives to come all together in a body to the very inside of the quarters and trenches, as soon as the Joloans had discharged their arquebuses, the Spaniards opened fire upon them, first with their artillery, and then with their arquebuses, killing many, and forcing the rest to retire in flight to the fort. 

The Spaniards pursued them, wounding and killing to the middle of the hill. But seeing that farther on the paths were so narrow and rough, they retreated before the heavy artillery fire from the heights, and the large stones hurled down upon them, and returned to their quarters. Upon many other days, efforts were made to reach the fort, but without any result. 

Gallinato felt that the war was prolonged beyond expectation.

So he built 2 forts:

1. One for his ships and the port
2. One half legua farther where they could take refuge and communicate with the camp

The forts were built of wood and fascines, and fortified with the artillery from the ships.

The Spaniards shut themselves up in these forts, whence from time to time they sallied, making incursions as far as the enemy's fort.

The latter always remained shut up in their fort without ever choosing to come down or to yield; for he was convinced that the Spaniards could not remain long in the island. 

The rains were fast setting in

Gallinato's men were becoming ill

His provisions were failing, without any achievement.

The enemy and other allies were boasting that they were gathering a large fleet to drive the Spaniards from Jolo.

He sent news of all that had occurred to the governor of Manila, with a plan of the island and fort and a relation of the difficulties which the enterprise presented. 

He sent this in a swift vessel, by Captain and Sargento-mayor Pedro Cotelo de Morales, toward the end of May 1602, in order to obtain instructions as to his procedure, and the necessary reënforcements of men and provisions.
