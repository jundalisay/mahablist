The withdrawal of Don Joan Ronquillo's camp from the Mindanao river left a Spanish garrison in La Caldera.

It passed into command of Captain Villagra at the death of Captain Joan Pacho in Jolo. 
- It was suffering for lack of provisions.

<!-- The people of the river could give them to the Spaniards, nor would the Joloans furnish any on account of the war declared upon them. -->

It urgently requested Governor Don Francisco Tello either to supply them or let them retreat to Manila. 

<!-- presidio with provisions, soldiers, and ammunition, or to allow them to retire to Manila—a thing of which they were most desirous—since there they gained no other special result than that of famine, and of incarceration in that fort, and of no place wherein to seek their sustenance. -->

<!-- The governor, in view of their insistence in the matter; and having but  -->

There was little money in the royal exchequer.

 <!-- with which to provide for and maintain the said presidio—and for the same reason the punishment that was to be inflicted upon the Joloans for their outrages upon the Spaniards, and their insurrection was deferred—and thinking that the return to Mindanao matters would be a long question: he was inclined to excuse the difficulty and anxiety of maintaining the presidio of La Caldera. -->

So he consulted the Audiencia and other intelligent persons.

<!-- , and requested them to give him their opinion.  -->

<!-- But he first communicated his wishes to them and gave them some reasons with which he tried to persuade them to give him the answer that he desired.  -->

The Audiencia advised to:
- reënforce and maintain the garrison
- attend to the affairs of Jolo and the Mindanao river as soon as possible

<!-- , even if what was necessary for those two places should be withdrawn from some other section. They said that this was the most urgent need, and the one which required the greatest attention in the islands, both in order to pacify those provinces and to keep them curbed; lest, seeing the Spaniards totally withdrawn, they should gain courage and boldly venture still farther, and come down to make captures among the Pintados and carry the war to the very doors of the Spaniards. [120]  -->

But the governor withdrew the garrison anyaway. 

He sent orders to Captain Villagra to burn the fort in La Caldera and return to Manila.

<!-- This was quickly done, for the captain and the soldiers of the garrison waited for nothing more than to dismantle the fort and leave.  -->

When the Joloans saw the Spaniards abandoning the country, they were persuaded that the Spanish were spent. 

 <!-- the latter would return to Mindanao no more, and that they had not sufficient forces to do so. -->

<!-- Thereupon they gained fresh resolution and courage, and  -->

So they united with the people of Buhahayen on the river, and equipped a number of caracoas and other craft to raid the Visayas. 

<!-- descend upon the coast of Pintados to plunder them and make captives.  -->

The people of Tampacan lost hope of getting further help from the Spaniards. 

 <!-- and of the latter's return to the river, since they had also abandoned the fort of La Caldera and left the country, came to terms with and  -->

So they joined the people of Buhahayen in order to avoid the war and injuries.


Then all turned their arms against the Spaniards, promising themselves to make many incursions into their territory and gain much plunder. Accordingly

They prepared their fleet and chose two of the experienced chiefs Sali and Silonga to command them. 

<!-- , of the river of Mindanao, called .  -->

They left the Mindanao River in July 1599, in the season of the vendavals, with 50 caracoas with:
- over 3,000 soldiers armed with arquebuses, campilans, carasas, other weapons with handles
- many culverins

They steered toward the islands of Oton and Panay, and neighboring islands. 

They passed Negros Island and went to the river of Panay, which they ascended for 5 leguas to the chief settlement, where the alcalde-mayor and some Spaniards were living. 

They sacked the settlement, burned the houses and churches, captured many native Christians—men, women, and children—upon whom they committed many murders, cruelties, and outrages. 

They pursued these in boats more than 10 leguas up the river, and destroyed all the crops. 

The alcalde-mayor, and those who could, fled to the mountains. The enemy could do what they pleased.

After they had burned all the vessels in the river, they left the river of Panay with their boats laden with pillaged goods and captive Christians. 

They did the same in the other islands and towns which they passed. 

Then they returned to Mindanao, without any opposition, with a quantity of gold and goods and more than  800 captives, besides the people whom they had killed.

In Mindanao, they divided the spoil, and agreed to get ready a larger fleet for the next year, and return to make war better prepared. [121]

This daring attack hurt the Visayas because of the terror it brought. 

<!-- of the Mindanaos worked great injury to the islands of Pintados, both on account of their deeds there and also on account of the fear and  with which they inspired the natives;  -->

The Spaniards had kept the Pintaods subject, tributary, and disarmed. They could not defend against their enemies like during the time before the Spanish came.  

 <!-- nor left them the means to defend themselves, as they used to do when there were no Spaniards in the country. of peaceful and subjected Indians -->

Many towns revolted and withdrew to the tingues, [122] and refused to descend to their houses, magistrates, and encomenderos. 

<!-- As was reported daily, they all had a great desire to revolt and rebel, but they were appeased and reduced again to subjection by a few promises and presents from their encomenderos and religious who showed great pity and sadness over their injuries. Although  -->

<!-- In Manila, people regretted these injuries, and still more those which were expected in the future from the enemy, they did nothing but regret them—since the governor was ill provided with ship and other necessities for the defense—and reckon them with the loss which they had suffered for having raised the camp on the river of Mindanao and dismantled the presidio of La Caldera. -->

The Mindanaos and Joloans returned with over 70 well-equipped ships and more than 4,000 fighting men, led by the same Silonga and Sali, and other Mindanao and Jolo chiefs to the same islands of Pintados.

They targetted the Spanish town of Arevalo in Oton. 

Captain Joan Garcia de Sierra, alcalde-mayor of that province heard of this expedition.

<!-- and of the designs entertained by the enemy, took the most necessary precautions, and,  -->

He gathered into the town all the Spaniards who lived there. Then shut himself up in it with all of them. 

He repaired a wooden fort there and gathered there the women and their possessions. 

He and the Spaniards—about 70 men—armed with arquebuses, awaited the enemy. 

The enemy landed 1,500 armed with arquebuses, campilans, and carasas and marched against the Spanish town

<!-- latter, who intended to attack the river of Panay again, passed Negros Island and made for the town of Arevalo, where they anchored close to the native settlement.

The Spaniards, divided into troops, sallied forth and opened fire with their arquebuses upon the enemy with such vehemence that they forced them to retreat and take refuge on board their caracoas.

So great was the enemy's confusion that many Mindanaos were killed before they could embark.

Captain Joan Garcia de Sierra, who was on horseback, pursued the enemy so closely to the water's edge that the enemy cut off the legs of his mount with their campilans and brought him to the ground where they killed him. 

The enemy embarked with a heavy loss of men, and halted at the island of Guimaraez, [123] in sight of Arevalo.

Included among the enemy dead was one of the most noted chiefs and leaders.
<!-- There they counted their men, including the dead and the wounded, who were not a few, and among whom was .  -->

Then they sailed for Mindanao, making a great show of grief and sorrow, and sounding their bells and tifas. [124] 

They made no further delay at the Pintados, deriving little gain from the expedition, but much injury, and loss of men and reputation, which was felt more deeply upon their arrival in Jolo and Mindanao. 

They decided that their next expedition would have more ships and men.

<!-- In order to remedy this disaster, it was proposed to renew their  against the Pintados at the first monsoon with more , and it was so decided. -->
