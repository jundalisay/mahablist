<!-- After having sent Fray Diego de Guevara, prior of the monastery of St. Augustine in Manila, to the court of España by way of India, with news of this event

—but who was unable to reach Madrid for three years, because of his various fortunes in India, Persia, and Italia, through which countries he went—they immediately sent -->


The Spaniards sent to Macao:
- Captain Marco de la Cueva
- Fray Luys Gandullo of the Order of St. Dominic

<!-- , to the city of Macao in China, where the Portuguese were living, with letters for the chief captain and the council of that city. -->

They told the Council of Macao of:
- the revolt of the Sangleys
- the result of the war

They asked about any rumors of a Chinese fleet. 

<!-- At the same time, letters were taken from the governor to the Tutons, Aytaos, and visitors of the provinces of Canton and Chincheo, recounting the outbreak of the Chinese, which obliged the Spaniards to kill them.  -->

<!-- Upon their arrival at Macao,  -->

Marcos de la Cueva and Fray Luys Gandullo found that everything was quiet at Macao.

<!-- The Chinese had already heard of the insurrection and much of the result from some Sangleys who had fled from Manila in champans.

It was immediately learned in Chincheo that these Spaniards were in Macao, whereupon Captains Guansan Sinu and Guachan, wealthy men and usually engaged in trade with Manila, went to look for them.

Having learned the truth of the event, they took the letters for the mandarins and promised to deliver them. They urged other  -->

The merchants of Chincheo were afraid to go to Manila that year. 

The Spaniards urged them to continue their trade with Manila. 
- This was because Manila was short of supplies. 

 <!-- through them much of the necessity that the city [of Manila] was suffering was supplied.  -->

<!-- With this result and with some powder, saltpeter, and lead which Marcos de la Cueva had provided for the magazines, the latter left Macao, and sailed to Manila, which he reached in May, to the universal joy of the city over the news that he brought—which began to be verified immediately by the coming of  -->

The shortage in Manila was relieved by a fleet of 13 Chinese vessels with food and merchandise.

Don Pedro de Acuña received 3 letters from China:

The letter of the inspector-general was written on March 23 year of the reign of Vandel [i.e., Wanleh].

<!-- The eunuch's [192] letter was written on the sixteenth of the said month and year; and that of the viceroy, on the twenty-second of the month. -->

The governor answered these letters through the same messengers, civilly and authoritatively. 

He gave an explanation of the deed and justified the Spaniards, and offered friendship and trade anew with the Chinese. 

He said that their property, which had remained in Manila, would be restored to the owners, and that those imprisoned in the galleys would be freed in due season. 

First, however, he intended to use them for the Maluco expedition, which he was undertaking.


### Exodus and Death of Rich Manilans 

In June 1603, [189] 2 vessels were despatched from Manila to Nueva España under Don Diego de Mendoça.
- The flagship "Nuestra Señora de los Remedios"
- the almiranta "Sant Antonio."

 <!-- who had been sent that year by the viceroy, Marques de Montesclaros, with the usual reënforcements for the islands.  -->


Because of the troubles in Manila, many rich men of the city boarded these ships with their entire households and property for Nueva España.
- The almiranta had the greatest wealth that has ever left the Filipinas.

Both vessels experienced so severe storms during the voyage, in the altitude of 34 degrees, and before having passed Japon.
- The flagship had to return to Manila.
- The almiranta was swallowed up in the sea, and no one was saved. 

This was one of the greatest shipwrecks and calamities that the Filipinas suffered.





<!-- At this same time, , by the ships that continued to come from China that year, with the merchandise and with their principal captains. 

They were all of the same tenor—when translated into Castilian—from the Tuton and Haytao, and from the inspector-general of the province of Chincheo, and were on the matter of the insurrection of the Sangleys and their punishment. 

They were as follows: -->

<!-- [This letter occupies folios 113b-115a of the original edition of Morga. We have already presented that document in our V0L. XIII, p. 287, which is translated from a copy of the original manuscript. The answer of Acuña to this letter will be found in V0L. XIV, in the second document of that volume.] -->


### Japan Issue

The entrances into various provinces of Japon by the discalced religious of St. Francis and those of St. Dominic and St. Augustine, continued to be made, both in the Castilian vessel itself which was despatched that year to the kingdoms of Quanto, [193] and in other Japanese vessels which came to Manila with the silver and flour of the Japanese, in order to trade. 

This was permitted and allowed by Daifu, now called Cubosama, who that year sent the governor, through one of his servants, certain weapons and presents, in return for others which the governor had sent him. He answered the latter's letter as follows:



Letter from Daifusama, lord of Japon, to governor Don Pedro de Acuña, in the year one thousand six hundred and five.

I received two letters from your Lordship, and all the gifts and presents mentioned in the memorandum. Among them, when I received them, the wine made from grapes pleased me greatly.

During former years, your Lordship requested permission for six vessels, and last year for four, and I always granted your request. But, what angers me greatly is that among the four vessels that your Lordship requested was that one called "Antonio," which made the voyage without my orders. 

This was a very lawless act, and in contempt of me.

Can it be, perhaps, that your Lordship would send to Japon without my permission any vessel that you wished? 

Besides this, your Lordship and others have often negotiated about the sects of Japon, and requested many things in regard to them. This likewise I cannot concede; for this region is called Xincoco [Shinkoku], or "dedicated to the idols."

These have been honored with the highest adoration from the time of our ancestors until now, and their acts I alone cannot undo or destroy.

Consequently, it is not at all advisable that your religion be promulgated or preached in Japon; and if your Lordship wish to preserve friendship with these kingdoms of Japon and with me, do what I wish, and never do what is displeasing to me. Lastly, many have told me that many wicked and perverse Japanese, who go to that kingdom and live there for many years, afterward return to Japon. This makes me very angry. 

Consequently, your Lordship will, in the future, allow no one of the Japanese to come here in the vessels that come from your country. In other matters, your Lordship shall act advisedly and prudently, and shall so conduct affairs, that henceforth I may not be angered on account of them.
