Passport from Don Pedro de Acuña to the king of Terrenate

I, Don Pedro de Acuña, governor, captain-general, and president of the Filipinas Islands, and general of this army and fleet, declare that, over my signature, I hereby give security of life to the king of Terrenate, in order that he may come to talk with me—both to him and those whom he may bring with him—reserving to myself the disposal of all the others as I may see fit. 

I certify this in his Majesty's name. And I order that no person of this fleet molest him or any of his possessions, and that all observe what is herein contained. Given in Terrenate, April six, one thousand six hundred and six.

DON PEDRO DE ACUÑA


Within nine days Cachilamuja and Pablo de Lima returned to Terrenate with the king, the prince, his son, [201] and others of his relatives, cachils and sangajes, [202] under the said passport. 

They placed themselves under the governor's power, and he received them with great affection and respect. He lodged the king and his son in a good house in the settlement, under guard of a company.

The king restored the villages of Christians that his Majesty had possessed in the island of Moro, when the fort of Terrenate was lost by the Portuguese.

He placed his person and kingdom in his Majesty's power, and surrendered a quantity of muskets and heavy artillery that he had in some forts of the said island. 

The governor did not despoil him of his kingdom, but on the contrary allowed him to appoint two of his men to govern, whose choice was to be ratified by himself. 

The king, his son the prince, and their cachils and sangajes swore homage to his Majesty. The kings of Tidore and Bachan, and the sangaje of La Bua did the same, and covenanted and promised not to admit either the Dutch or other nations into Maluco for the clove-trade. 

They promised, as his Majesty's vassals, to go on all occasions to serve him with their persons, men, and ships, whenever summoned by whomever commanded the fort of Terrenate; that they would oppose no obstacles to the Moros who wished to become Christians; that if any wicked Christian went to their lands to turn renegade, they would surrender him; and other suitable things. 

Therewith great and small were content and pleased, since they were freed from the tyranny of the king of Terrenate.

The governor remitted to them the 1/3 of the tributes which they were wont to pay their king, and gave the Moros other advantages. 

Then he began to build a new and modern fort, in a very conspicuous and suitable location.

In order that the old fort might be better defended while the new one was being completed, he reduced it to a less size, by making new cavaliers and bastions, which he finished and furnished with ramparts and stout gates. He commenced another fort in the island of Tidore, on a good location near the settlement. 

After placing in order whatever he judged necessary in Terrenate and Tidore, and in the other towns and fortresses of Maluco, he returned with his fleet to the Filipinas.

He left Esquivel, with a garrison of  six hundred soldier—five hundred, in five companies, for Terrenate—in the fort of Terrenate to act as his assistant and as governor of Maluco; 

He also left there one large forge and a number of smiths, 65 pioneers, 35 stonecutters, 2 galliots, 2 well-armed brigantines, and crews of rowers.

The other company of soldiers was to be stationed in Tidore under command of Captain Alarcon.

 <!-- while ammunition and provisions for one year were left in both forts.  -->

In order to be more assured of the [peaceful] condition of the country, he took the king of Terrenate from it and carried him to Manila, as well as his son the prince, and 24 cachils and sangajes, most of them the king's relatives, to whom he showed every honor and good treatment. 

He explained to them why he took them, and that their return to Maluco depended on the security and tranquillity with which the Moros should conduct themselves in their obedience and service to his Majesty. [203] 

The 3 Portuguese galliots returned to Malaca, taking with them the Dutch who were in Maluco and the Portuguese captains and soldiers who had come to take part in this expedition.

The governor returned to Manila on May 31, 1606. 

<!-- He was received there with acclamations of joy and praise from the city, who gave thanks to God for so happy and prompt result in an undertaking of so great weight and importance. -->

During the governor's absence in Maluco, the royal Audiencia of the islands governed the Filipinas.

The Audiencia wished to drive a number of Japanese from the city, for they were a turbulent people and promised little security for the country. 

When this was attempted and force employed, the Japanese resisted, and the matter came to such a pass that they took arms to oppose it, and it was necessary for the Spaniards to take their arms also.

The affair assumed definite proportions, and some on either side wished to give battle. 

However, it was postponed by various means until, through the efforts of certain religious, the Japanese were quieted; and afterward as many as possible were embarked in vessels, although they resented it greatly.

This was one of the greatest dangers that has threatened Manila. There were few Spaniards.

The Japanese were more than 1,500. They are a spirited and very mettlesome race.

Had they come to blows on this occasion, the Spaniards would have fared ill. [204]

The governor, upon entering Manila, took over immediately the affairs of his government, especially the despatching of two vessels about to sail to Nueva España. 

He was present in person in the port of Cabit at the equipment and lading of the ships, and the embarcation of the passengers.

He was seized by some indisposition of the stomach which compelled him to return to Manila and take to his bed.

His pain and vomiting increased so rapidly that, without its being possible to relieve him, he died in great anguish on St. John's day, to the great sorrow and grief of the country. 


Especially did the king of Terrenate show and express his grief, for he had always received great honor and kind treatment from the governor.

<!-- It was suspected that his death had been violent, because of the severity and the symptoms of his illness.  -->

The physicians and surgeons saw that he had been poisoned.

<!-- having opened his body, declared, from the signs that they found, that , which made his death more regrettable. [205] The Audiencia buried the governor in the monastery of St. Augustine at Manila, with the pomp and ostentation due to his person and offices. Then, again taking charge of the government, the Audiencia despatched the vessels to Nueva España, whence advice was sent to his Majesty of the taking of Maluco and the death of the governor. -->

The flagship, in which Don Rodrigo de Mendoça was sailing as general and captain, reached Nueva España quickly with this news. 

The almiranta, notwithstanding that it left the islands at the same time, delayed more than 6 months.

80 persons who perished from disease were buried in the sea, while many others stricken by the disease died of it upon landing at the port of Acapulco.

Among these was the licentiate Don Antonio de Ribera, auditor of Manila, who had been appointed auditor of Mexico.


At the arrival of these vessels, it was learned that since the death of Don Pedro de Acuña, and the taking over of the government by the Audiencia, no change had occurred in the affairs of the islands; 

Their commerce was restricted because of the prohibition which forbade sending to the islands more than 500,000 pesos each year of the proceeds from the sale of the merchandise in Nueva España.

On account of this the people were in need, as this amount appeared little for the many Spaniards and for the extent of the trade—by which all classes are sustained, as they have no other resources or capital. 

Also, although the gaining of Maluco had been so important for affairs in those islands themselves, and their punishment for the reduction of the other rebels—especially those of Mindanao and Jolo, from whom the Filipinas had received so great injury—the desirable quiet and stability had not been secured. 

The Mindanaos and the Joloans still were raiding the Visayas. 

Maluco kept Joan de Esquivel busy as governor there because the natives were Mahometan. By nature they are:
- easily persuaded and fickle
- restless and ready for disturbances and wars. 

Daily and in different parts the natives were being incited and aroused to rebellion.

Esquivel and his captains punished and pacified them. But they could not do what was necessary to quiet so many disturbances. 

The soldiers were dying, and the food giving out. The aid sent from Manila could not arrive at the time or in so great quantity as was requested, because of the perils of the voyage and the straits of the royal treasury. [206] 
The coming of vessels to Maluco at this time from Holanda and Zelanda was not less prejudicial to all our interests. 

The Dutch had so great interests in the islands.

 <!-- and having established their interests there so firmly, -->

They were coming in squadrons by the India route, to recover what they had lost in Amboino, Terrenate, and other islands. 

With their countenance, the Moros were revolting against the Spaniards, who had their hands full with them, and more so with the Dutch, for the latter were numerous, and more dangerous enemies than the natives.
